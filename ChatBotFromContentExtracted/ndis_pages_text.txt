If early childhood or local area coordinator partners are not available in your area, or you need more help coordinating your supports and services,
the NDIA may fund a support coordinator in your NDIS plan
. A support coordinator will help you use your plan to pursue your goals, live more independently, increase your skills and be included in your community and in employment.
Specialist support coordination is a higher level of support coordination. It is an option for people whose situations are more complex and who need specialist help to coordinate their supports and services.

In-kind services in your NDIS plan

In-kind explained
Before the NDIS was established, state, territory and Commonwealth governments pre-paid a lump sum amount to service providers so they could provide supports to people with disability. When the NDIS started, this changed.
Under the NDIS, funding is given to a participant so they can choose who delivers their supports and when and where.
In some cases, providers are still being paid a lump sum and delivering pre-paid supports to NDIS participants. Participants use these supports but don’t buy the supports with funds in their plans. These supports are known as ‘in-kind’ supports.
Gradually in-kind supports have changed to being paid from your NDIS plan. Some pre-paid arrangements have already changed, and the remaining will occur by 31 December 2026.
If you are an NDIS participant who currently uses in-kind supports, the following information may help you to understand:
how in-kind supports work in your NDIS plan now.
how in-kind funding arrangements are changing.
In-kind services in your NDIS plan
If you get an in-kind support, it should be included in your plan if it is reasonable and necessary.
As of 30 June 2024, there are two in-kind programs still operating in each jurisdiction, which are due to be phased out by 31 December 2026:
Personal Care in Schools (PCIS) programs
School Transport Programs
In WA, the in-kind Staffed Residential Service is due to be phased out by 30 June 2025.
If you already get in-kind supports remember they have been pre-paid. You don’t need to pay for them with your NDIS plan funds.
If you are still unsure about your in-kind supports, contact your NDIS Planner or Local Area Coordinator (LAC). You should contact them if you believe your planner didn’t consider your in-kind supports when your current plan was made.
Plan management for in-kind supports
You can choose who manages your NDIS plan, but the NDIA must manage all your pre-paid in-kind supports because they have been pre-paid.

What are safeguards?
The aim of the NDIS is to give participants choice and control over their lives. Safeguards are rules in place to help protect you from harm, abuse, neglect or exploitation.
Why are safeguards needed?
Safeguards are important to protect your right to be safe and receive quality services from NDIS providers and workers.
Some of these safeguards are in the Australian Consumer Law which says:
You have the right to be treated fairly
You have rights when buying goods and services from a business or provider.
The law makes it clear that you have the right to:
be treated fairly
be given accurate information before you buy
cancel a faulty service
a repair, replacement or refund if something goes wrong.
Not all of these laws are in place when you buying something privately, such as from a friend, garage sale or someone selling an item they’ve owned.
It is okay to speak up if you:
feel unsafe with your provider
are not happy with the quality of the services from your provider.
Speaking up can help to improve services for you and other people.
You may want to talk to your provider first to see if they can put things right.
You can also contact the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission:
visit their website
phone 1800 035 544.
More information about your rights and where to go for help is also available on the
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
website including:
your rights when you buy something
– in Easy English and 8 languages
fact sheet on
where to go for advice or complaints
video animation on
smart shopping and your rights
in Easy English
Educational video animation on
shop smart and use your rights
.
The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission
The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission (NDIS Commission) handles complaints about the quality and safety of NDIS supports and services. The NDIS Commission is an independent agency.
More information:
difference between the NDIS Commission, the NDIS and the NDIA
how the NDIS Commission can help participants receive safe and quality supports
.
NDIS Worker Screening Check
The NDIS Worker Screening Check is one way to reduce risk of harm to people with disability. This clears a person to work in certain roles.
Registered NDIS providers must ensure that workers in certain roles have had this check or hold a valid
acceptable check
.
Unregistered providers and self-managed participants can choose to ask workers to get an NDIS worker screening clearance.
Unregistered providers and self-managed participants can request access to a database to check the clearance status of an NDIS worker. Registered NDIS providers have automatic access to the database through the NDIS Commission Portal.
Visit the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission website for more information on worker screening:
NDIS self-managed participants
registered NDIS providers
unregistered providers
NDIS workers
.
When will participant safeguards be discussed?
We encourage participants to consider the safeguards, strategies and support mechanisms they have in their lives when developing their statement of supports, deciding on their support requirements, developing their plan and putting their plan into action.
The planning and assessment conversation is a chance to discus actual and potential risks to the participant.
The NDIA planner and participant work together to identify risks and any safeguards that may be required, and discuss plan management options. The planner helps to identify how participants can enhance the existing safeguards they have in their lives, ways they could enhance their capacity to protect themselves from risk, and other formal safeguarding mechanisms they might wish to access.
If required, an NDIS Local Area Coordinator can help to monitor and assist in strengthening safeguards in the participant’s life.

What to expect
The plan reassessment experience will start with a participant check in, where we contact you near your current plan end date to book your plan reassessment meeting.
As part of this call, we will check in with you and see how you are going with your current NDIS plan, and if your circumstances have changed in the last year.
This will help us prepare for your plan reassessment meeting, and make sure we have the information we need to make sure your plan review experience is personalised to your needs.
For some participants, a full plan reassessment will not be needed and we will not need to ask you all of the planning questions.
This means your early childhood partner, LAC, or NDIA planner can spend more time checking in with you, see how you’re going, and answer any questions you may have about your NDIS plan.
If your circumstances have changed or you would like a full plan reassessment, we will work with you to understand what information you may need to provide.
You can have your plan reassessment meeting face-to-face, over the phone, or even via a video call if available - whatever suits you best. You will also have the option to invite supports along to your check-in, such as a family member, friend or Support Coordinator.
Information you need for your plan reassessment meeting
You may need to provide assessments or reports from some of your service providers for your plan reassessment meeting. This is to show how your supports and services are helping you work towards your goals.
These reports can also make recommendations for supports and services you might need in the future. Your early childhood partner, LAC or the NDIA will discuss this with you.

Tips for preparing for your plan reassessment
In the lead up to your plan reassessment think about:
What worked well in your plan
What didn’t work well
Have you made progress towards your goals
Which goals you want to continue to pursue and which goals you want to change
Who can help you pursue your goals
Will you need NDIS support in the future
Would you like to change how all or some of your plan funding is managed.
You do not need to pick new goals at each plan review but your plan, supports and services should be helping you make progress towards your goals.
Find out what to expect in your
plan reassessment meeting
.
Longer plan durations for participants in a stable situation
Participants are able to request plan durations of up to three (3) years.
For participants with support needs which are unlikely to change, a long plan duration means they can carry on with their lives without needing to go through frequent plan reassessment processes.
These longer term plans are designed for participants who are:
in a stable situation with their support needs unlikely to change
confident in using their funding to pursue their goals
focused on learning new skills, employment or becoming more active in the community.
For children younger than 7, we recommend a plan length of 12 months. This is due to the major changes in early childhood. Sometimes, we can do a plan for up to 24 months for young children, if it is better aligned with important transition points and milestones. For further information go to
Our Guidelines –Creating your plan
.
To find out if a longer plan duration is suitable for your situation, please talk with your early childhood partner, LAC or planner.
To prepare for this conversation, you will want to consider:
any life changes you’re expecting to make over the next three years (e.g. leaving school, starting or leaving work or a change in your living situation)
how connected you are with your social and community supports
goals you want to pursue and preferences around plan duration.
If your circumstances change at any time during your plan period, your early childhood partner, LAC or planner will be able to help you review your support needs and undertake a plan reassessment if required to ensure your plan will suit your new situation.

This section contains information about what we consider when we make decisions under the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).
Our guidelines set out some of the NDIA’s operational information. They are based on the NDIS Legislation and Rules.
They explain what we need to consider and how we make decisions based on the legislation.
We are working to update all of our guidelines to make them simple, clear and easy to use.

Families and carers provide help and support that could otherwise be provided by formal services or paid support workers.
They are often one of the greatest advocates for people with disabilities, providing practical and emotional support to help them live their best life.
Moreover, if the person they care for wants it, carers play a vital role in supporting them to join the NDIS, set their goals and use their NDIS plan effectively.
In addition to the government-funded programs available to support carers, an NDIS participant might use funding in their plan to facilitate respite.
Respite supports participants and their carers by giving carers short breaks from their caring responsibilities. It also gives participants time away from their families.
For a participant, this might mean:
joining a new community group
having a short stay out of home to try new things, make new friends or develop new skills.
temporary periods of extra personal supports so that the participant can remain at home when families and/or carers are not available
support to participate in community activities, resulting in a break for carers.
For carers, taking some time off can help them better manage their own health and improve their wellbeing.
In deciding whether to fund or provide a support, we will take into account what is reasonable to expect from families, carers, informal networks and the community.
More information for carers and how to include respite in an NDIS plan is available on the
Carers Australia website
.
We also encourage you to talk with your Local Area Coordinator or Planner on what supports might be available in your local community.

What is a nominee under the National Disability Insurance Scheme?
People with disability are presumed to have capacity to make decisions that affect their own lives. This is usually the case, and it will not be necessary to appoint a person or a nominee where it is possible to support, and build the capacity of participants to make their own decisions for the purposes of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).
However, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 (NDIS Act) recognises that there may be circumstances where it is necessary for a person to be appointed as a nominee of a participant to act on behalf of, or make decisions on behalf of a participant.  It is important to remember that this is a last resort measure.
Appointments of nominees will be justified only when it is not possible for participants to be assisted to make decisions for themselves. Appointments of nominees usually come about as a result of a participant requesting that a nominee be appointed. More information on the appointment process is set out below.
It is only in rare and exceptional cases that the NDIA will find it necessary to appoint a nominee for a participant who has not requested that an appointment be made. In appointing a nominee, the NDIA will have regard to the participant’s wishes and the participant’s circumstances (including their formal and informal support networks such as carers, family and guardians). The NDIS Act (section 80) and Nominee Rules (Part 5) set outs the duties of nominees to ensure that participants have every opportunity to participate in the decision-making process for their plans.
Under the NDIS, there are 2 types of nominee: a plan nominee and a correspondence nominee. A single person can be appointed as both plan nominee and correspondence nominee. Either type of nominee can be appointed either indefinitely or for a specified term. The NDIA will issue an instrument of appointment which sets out the type of nominee being appointed, what acts and decisions they can do, the length of the appointment (if any) and any other relevant matters such as whether there are other nominees appointed.
Duties to the participant and the NDIS
As a nominee, under the NDIS Act you have:
duties to the participant
duties to the NDIS.
Duties to the participant
Duty to understand the participant’s wishes, and promote the participant’s personal and social wellbeing
As a nominee, you must:
find out what the participant would like to happen
act in a way that supports the participant’s personal and social wellbeing.
Sometimes the participant may not be able to let you know what they want. When this happens, you must try to work out what they think the participant would like to happen. You might do this by:
looking back on other decisions the participant made
thinking about the experiences you’ve had with the participant
talking with other people who know the participant well.
Duty to consult
Before making an NDIS decision, you must also talk with other people in the participant’s life. These people include:
any other appointed NDIS nominee the participant has
any court-appointed decision-maker the participant has
any other decision-maker the participant has appointed
any person who helps the participant manage day-to-day activities and make decisions, for example a support worker.
Duty to develop the participant’s capacity
As a nominee you must help build the participant’s skills to make decisions. Ideally, to a point where the participant can make decisions for themselves. This would mean they no longer need a nominee.
The NDIS must help you with this duty.
Duty to avoid or manage conflicts of interest
As a nominee you must tell the NDIS about any conflict of interest you have in relation to the participant. For example, if you provide the participant with services that you get paid for, NDIS needs to know You must also tell the NDIS how you will manage this conflict of interest.
For body corporate nominees only
A body corporate nominee is an organisation or company appointed as the participant’s nominee.
For each participant they are the nominee for, they must:
make sure there is a person (officer or employee) who is involved with making the nominee decisions
tell the NDIA who that person is
tell the NDIA if that person changes.
Duties to the NDIS
Notices
We may send you or the participant a notice. A notice, usually a letter, will tell you when you need to complete an action or provide us with information.
As a nominee, you need to give us the information the notice asks for in the timeframe we tell you, unless you have a reason.
Correspondence nominees
We send all notices to the correspondence nominee. When we send a notice to you, as the correspondence nominee, we treat this as giving notice to the participant.
Sometimes we contact the participant directly and give them a notice. If we do this, we will tell you that we gave the participant a notice and provide you with the details.
Plan nominees
We must tell plan nominees when we send a notice to the participant about the preparation, management or review of their plan. This includes the details of the notice.
Notice about the nominee’s ability to act
We will send a written notice to you asking you to tell us of any event or change in situation that may affect:
your ability to act as a nominee
your ability to comply with notices we give them
our ability to give you notices.
Notice about use of the participant’s NDIS funding
We may send plan nominees a notice asking them to tell us how the participant has used their NDIS funds.
Notices asking the participant to do something personally
When the notice asks the participant to do something personally, the participant must do this. You can’t do it on the participant’s behalf. For example, the notice asks the participant to complete an allied health assessment. The participant must attend the allied health assessment personally. This is not something you can do for the participant. But, the participant could ask you to go with them if they want. You should check with the person doing the assessment that this is okay.
Guardianship Information
Guardianship is different from nominees. Guardianship is the authority to manage the legal and non-legal affairs of a person such as power of attorney or Centrelink nominations. Guardians are not nominees under the NDIS and there is no automatic process for guardians to be made nominees. Where it has been identified by the NDIA that the participant requires a nominee and there is a guardianship arrangement in place, the presumption is that the guardian will be appointed as the nominee.
Guardians being appointed as nominees.
As part of the appointment process for nominees the NDIA will have regard to whether the participant has a guardian, and will take the views of the guardian into consideration. There is a presumption that a guardian should be appointed nominee where their responsibilities are comparable to the duties of a nominee.
NDIS participants under 18
For a participant under 18 years of age child representatives instead of nominees can be appointed. A child representative is only appointed where the NDIA is making a determination that a person other than the person or persons with parental responsibility should be the child representative. There are rules about who has parental responsibility for a child participant and when a child representative can be appointed by the NDIA. Further information can be found at:

Receiving an approved NDIS plan
While you may work with an early childhood partner or local area coordinator partner to develop your NDIS funded plan, all participant plans must be approved by the NDIA.
After it is approved, you will receive your plan either in person or in the mail, and through the myplace portal.
Your early childhood partner, local area coordinator partner or NDIA planner will let you know the next steps and how long it will take to receive your approved plan.
During your planning conversation you can request a copy of your plan printed in a variety of accessible formats such as Braille, electronic text (on CD), large print or audio (on CD), or translated into your preferred language.
You can also
change your communication preferences
in the myplace participant portal.
What happens if you disagree with what’s in your plan?
You have the right to ask for an internal review of your plan by the NDIA.
Your early childhood partner, local area coordinator partner or NDIA planner will explain how to do this and can put you in touch with advocates who can help you with this process.
Requesting a review
A
request for internal review
of a decision must be made within three months of receiving notice of the decision from the NDIA.
If you’re not happy with the internal review, you can apply for a review by the
Administrative Review Tribunal
, which exists outside the NDIA.

6 - Our Guideline
Learning from Merits Review statement
The NDIA recognises that the Merits review system is a fundamental part of the Commonwealth administrative law framework and our responsibility towards our participants. As such, we are dedicated to reviewing Tribunal decisions and considering learnings from them in order to strengthen the quality, consistency, and fairness of NDIA decisions.
The Agency has committed to a legal review of all decisions handed down by the ART for consideration of their impact on Agency policy and operational guidelines. Relevant adverse decisions will be escalated internally for consideration by senior management. Agency decisions, including learnings and key insights from Tribunal outcomes, are also included in risk, performance and significant issues reporting to the Senior Leadership Team and NDIA Board and shared with the Department of Social Services to inform policy development.
This commitment builds on a strong foundation already in place through the NDIA’s Dispute Resolution Improvement Strategy, which is instrumental towards the development of quality assurance and reporting functions for all ART applications to ensure consistency and transparency in our decision making.
What is an internal review of a decision?
If you are not happy with a decision we have made, such as our decision to approve your plan, we may be able to review that decision.
This is called an internal review of a decision.
In an internal review of a decision, we will check if we made the right decision under the law by looking at the facts and circumstances at the time of the internal review. If we need more information to make our decision, we’ll contact you.
You can also give us any additional information when you ask for a review.
If your situation and support needs have changed since our decision, you can also
ask us to change your plan
.
How do we review decisions?
We want to help you understand how and why we make decisions.
There are some decisions we can review, and there are other decisions we can’t review.
Our Guidelines,
‘Reviewing our Decisions’
has information about:
what kinds of decisions we can review
who can ask for an internal review of a decision, and for what types of decisions
what happens during an internal review of a decision
what you can do if you still don’t agree with the outcome after an internal review of a decision.
What other options are available to you?
There are other options available to you if you don’t agree with a decision we have made.
You can ask us to explain our decision. We can also give you written reasons for our decision. Contact the NDIA for more information about this option.
If the decision is about your approved plan, you can talk to your
Early Childhood Partner, Local Area Coordinator or Support Coordinator
for help with other ways to use your plan to access supports.
If you are not a participant, you can seek help from an Early Childhood Partner or Local Area Coordinator to find supports available for you. To access the NDIS, you can submit a new access request. Visit the
access request
and
support for people who are not eligible
pages for more information.
We may identify your supports are best delivered by other service systems. Visit
mainstream and community supports
for more information.
You can get more evidence ahead of your next plan review. For more information about what evidence you may need, visit

and

If you are worried about the quality or safety of the NDIS supports or services you are receiving, you can make a complaint to the
NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission
.
Make an enquiry, provide feedback or raise a complaint
We have a ‘no wrong door’ approach for how people contact us, and we welcome all feedback, including complaints and compliments. We are committed to improving our service by listening to those who share their feedback.
You can make an enquiry, provide feedback or raise a complaint:
Online:
Feedback form
or live chat
Email:
[email protected]
Phone: 1800 800 110 (NDIS National Contact Centre), Monday – Friday 8am to 8pm
In person: by visiting an NDIS office, Local Area Coordinator (LAC) or Early childhood (EC) partner
Mail: NDIA, GPO Box 700, Canberra ACT 2601.
If you need an interpreter, call the Translation and Interpreting Service (TIS) on 131 450 and ask to be connected to the NDIS
If you have hearing or speech loss, contact TTY on 1800 555 677 or the National Relay Service on 1800 555 727.
If we can’t help you, we will try to refer you to someone who can.
What happens when you make an enquiry, provide feedback or raise a complaint
If you make a complaint about your experience with the NDIA, the way we work, or the conduct of a staff member, we will do our best to resolve your complaint as quickly as possible.
To encourage you to feel safe and supported to share your views and experiences with us, we have an Enquiries, Feedback and Complaints policy. The policy outlines what you can expect from us and includes our enquiries, feedback and complaints handling principles. They are:
transparent – we will make it simple and clear to raise a complaint. We will do this with accessible and well-publicised channels.
responsive – we will consider your complaint quickly and seriously. We will let you know what to expect.
respectful – we recognise your safety and rights when you raise an issue. Our staff are accountable and will respond to you with empathy and understanding.
empowering – we encourage and enable people with disability to raise issues with us directly. We value your experience by learning from it to improve how we do things.
connected – we will support you to access, engage with, and navigate our processes. We will support you to get as close to your desired outcome as possible, while adhering to NDIS legislation and guidelines.
How will the NDIA manage my complaint?
There are 8 steps we follow to manage complaints. The steps are:
acknowledge
assess and record
contact
resolve or refer
communicate
respond
follow-up
consider and learn.
You can read more about these steps in our Enquiries, Feedback and Complaints policy.
After a complaint has been received, we aim to:
acknowledge your complaint within 1 day
contact you within 2 days
resolve your complaint within 21 days.
Some complaints can be resolved much sooner than 21 days. If we need more information to resolve your complaint, we may contact you to get more information. If your complaint is complex and involves several issues, it may take longer to resolve your complaint. We will let you know if this is the case.
We may need to contact you to confirm your identity if we need to access and discuss your personal information. If you are making a complaint for someone else, we may contact you to make sure that you are authorised by that person to speak on their behalf, and to access information that may be needed to manage the complaint.
If you do not have that person’s consent, you can still make a complaint, but we will only be able to respond in general terms.
To help you feel safe and supported to share your views and experiences with us, we have an Enquiries, Feedback and Complaints policy available for download.

Enquiries, Feedback and Complaints policy – easy read (PDF 7.6MB)
Enquiries, Feedback and Complaints policy – easy read (DOCX 72KB)
Enquiries, Feedback and Complaints overview (DOCX 288KB)
More information and resources will be available soon.
What happens if I don’t agree with the outcome of my complaint?
If you are unhappy with our resolution process, you can ask for a supervisor or manager to review your complaint and how it was handled. You may also choose to contact the Commonwealth Ombudsman.
The Commonwealth Ombudsman can consider complaints about the actions and decisions we take, including how we have managed a complaint. You can contact the Commonwealth Ombudsman after you have attempted to resolve your issue with us by:
calling 1300 362 072
or visiting the
Commonwealth Ombudsman website
.
What can I do if I have concerns about an NDIS provider or worker?
The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission (NDIS Commission) is an independent Commonwealth agency established to improve the quality and safety of NDIS supports and services.
The NDIS Commission can take complaints from anyone about:
NDIS services or supports that were not provided in a safe and respectful way
NDIS services and supports that were not delivered to an appropriate standard
how an NDIS provider has managed a complaint about services or supports provided to an NDIS participant.
You can make a complaint to the NDIS Commission by either:
completing a
complaint contact form
calling 1800 035 544
if you are deaf or hard of hearing, contact:
TTY on 1800 555 677
National Relay Service on 1800 555 727.
For more information, visit the
NDIS Commission website
.
What if I don't agree with an access or planning decision?
If you disagree with a decision that we have made, such as a decision about your access to the NDIS or about your NDIS plan, you can request a review. Your request for an internal review must be within 3 months of the decision.
More information, including how to request a review is available on the
internal review of a decision
page.

We employ people with disability and make sure they:
can access secure and sustainable employment opportunities, and
are respected for their skills.
We also help people with disability develop their careers. You can read more about this in our:
NDIA Disability Inclusion Plan 2021-25 (PDF 2.6MB)
NDIA Disability Inclusion Plan 2022-25 - Easy Read (PDF 4.8MB)
Candidates with disability
If you're a person with disability who wants to make a difference, we want to hear from you.
We want to talk to people with lived experience of disability, or people who care for a person with disability. You represent the community we serve.
We support all our staff with disability. We are a ‘Gold Member’ of the
Australian Network on Disability (AND)
.
We want you to share your experience with us.
If you join the Agency, our Disability Liaison Officers work with you to make sure you have the equipment and adjustments you need to do your role.
Disability Confident Recruiter
We're an accredited
Disability Confident Recruiter
through our partnership with AND.
This means we make changes to the hiring process for everyone. We provide an excellent experience for all candidates and hire people from a range of groups, including people with disability.
Affirmative Measures - Disability Employment
We want to show the community the value people with disability can bring to any organisation.
This means we have some jobs that are only available to people with disability, or a particular type of disability. We call this Affirmative Measures - Disability employment.
This makes sure people with disability are represented in Australian Public Service (APS) agencies.
You can view
NDIA vacancies for Affirmative Measures
positions.
You can read more about
Affirmative Measures for people with disability
on the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) website.
RecruitAbility Scheme
We also take part in the APS RecruitAbility scheme. This means we take people with disability to an advanced stage in the hiring process.
This only happens if the person opts into the RecruitAbility scheme and meets the minimum requirements for the job.
We’ll ask if you want to opt into the RecruitAbility scheme in the Diversity section of the online application form.
You must tick the ‘opt in’ box to join the RecruitAbility scheme. You won’t be automatically included by having a disability.
Read more about the RecruitAbility scheme on the
Australian Public Service Commission Recruitability
page.
Reasonable adjustments
We provide reasonable adjustments during the hiring process. This includes access, equipment or other practical help.
Please tell us what you need in the application, or contact us.
You can do this by
sending us an email
or calling 1300 138 337.
Employee Network
The Employee Disability Network (EDN) helps employees with disability connect with each other and work collaboratively to create a workplace where employees with disability thrive.

Dominic Binny
I have a double degree in Economics (Honours) and Arts, where I was able to learn more about my educational passions in Economics and Psychology at Monash University. I’ve always had a fascination of how humans act and think the way they do. I like to think of myself as a Behavioural Economist these days!
I am Geelong-based, where the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) head office is. Though I split my time with Melbourne, where the rest of my family is, as they are a big part of my life.
Outside of work, I have a few hobbies to keep me busy such as badminton, hiking and playing games (both boardgames and computer). My main hobby though is dodgeball where I’ve even travelled interstate and overseas to play! I use it as a good way to stay active, and an excuse to take holidays and travel.
I’ve been Director of the Economics and Insights team since early 2023, setting up and leading the team in that time. The team examines a range of economic issues impacting the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) and broader care and support sectors using economic frameworks, research, and modelling tools.
We aim to inform policy decisions, particularly for pricing and market interventions, by using economic analyses to promote better understanding of the state of the NDIS and care and support sectors. This includes the impact the NDIS has on the wider Australian economy and other sectors such as healthcare and aged care.
I’ve always wanted to help people and better society in some way. I believe that was main reason I found my way into the NDIA graduate program, and Australian Public Service more broadly.
When I first heard about the NDIS, it certainly caught my eye considering my personal experience with disability. Both myself with hearing loss (single-sided deafness) and supporting my dad who had a vision impairment. I felt I had a stronger connection with the goals and values of the NDIA, than I would with other Government Departments. Not to mention the chance to be part of a life-changing reform for Australian society!
My advice for future NDIA Graduates is:
Try your best at anything you do. Nobody can ask you to do more than your best.
Don’t be afraid to ask questions or provide your opinion. This is a great way to learn and consolidate your own knowledge. It also reinforces that you have your own thoughts, and it is OK if they are different from others.
Try new things and hop out of your comfort zone! Even if it is little by little, you broaden your horizon the more you do. I never did this prior to working, and it is something I wish I did.
James Kendall
I’m Melbourne-based and completed my studies at Monash University. I was part of the 2023 Graduate Program and undertook rotations in Risk and Procurement.
I currently work in the Enterprise Risk Team within the Risk Management Branch. We are focussed on providing an aggregated view of the Agency’s risk landscape and collecting performance commentary for Board reporting. Recently, a major focus of my role has been designing and developing a quantitative scoring model for enterprise risk.
I was attracted to work in a location that would provide some positive benefits to Australians living with disability and their supporters. No matter where you are in the Agency you can be confident that your efforts are helping to deliver the Scheme and that you are helping to make a meaningful difference. Additionally, the Graduate Program lets you undertake multiple rotations around the Agency that enables graduates to get real experience in multiple roles.
The best benefit of the Graduate Program was having the opportunity to network and build friendships with the other graduates in the 2023 cohort from across Australia. Throughout the program we attended numerous events as a cohort, and it was fantastic to work with the other graduates, establish a network and build friendships that last long past the conclusion of the Graduate Program.
My advice for future NDIA Graduates is:
Ask questions – Joining the agency is joining a team, and there will be plenty of times when work can be challenging or confusing. Don’t be afraid to say that “I don’t understand this?” or “How can I improve this?” and learn from the wisdom and experience of your teammates and colleagues.
Aim higher – Before submitting work to your team, ask yourself if the deliverable is as good as it can possibly be? Can you improve it? Is there a suggestion you can provide to your team that might improve the process or make the task better the next time it is undertaken? Always look for ways improve your work or suggestions that will help your team.
Be open to change – The grad year is jam-packed with activities, not to mention undertaking multiple rotations within the Agency, you’ll find yourself constantly working with new people and taking on new responsibilities. Expect change, expect to keep learning from it and always meet it with an open mind.
Dana Cerone
The NDIS resonates closely with me and is somewhere I have always hoped to work for. The graduate program seemed like a great opportunity to join the APS world and begin my career in a field of work that I love.
Currently, I work as a Mental Health & Wellbeing Officer, and I love the team I work with. We are all there to support and lean on each other, whether it’s with work tasks or personal challenges. Each person is valued for what they bring to the team, with opportunities to exceed in our strengths, and support from each other for the areas we can improve on.
The most rewarding part of my job is seeing the positive impact it can have on staff members. Sharing the amazing resources, we have for mental health & wellbeing is such a good feeling, especially when you see the shock and excitement from other staff not having known we have so much to offer! Also, having staff come back to us with such appreciation for the supports we have available with our EAP provider (e.g. counselling, financial counselling, nutrition appointments) makes it worth doing what we do!
My advice for future NDIA Graduates is:
Make the most of every opportunity! Go into each rotation with a positive mindset & enthusiasm and take any opportunities you can.
Network, network, network! Build friendships with fellow grads. They will either be your support network, your go-to people, or you’ll motivate each other to strive for greatness!
Look after yourself. It can be exhausting starting a new job, especially if you are new to full-time work. So, make sure you find ways to unwind, take care, and come into work feeling refreshed! Also check out our Well+ intranet page for mental health & wellbeing support resources, or feel free to reach out to our team any time!
Michelle Lin
I am currently a Health Liaison Officer. Health Liaison Officers work directly with Hospitals to facilitate the safe discharge of participants from hospital into the community. We are the main point of contact for Hospitals and provide specialist advice and guidance to external stakeholders.
I currently work with the Southeast Sydney Local Health District. I meet with staff from this health district weekly to discuss specific cases. I also provide support with assisting patients admitted to hospital in accessing the scheme. My team help discharge patients into the community and relieve pressure placed on the Australian Health system.
I was interested in working in government as I wanted to be in a role where my work had a significant impact on the lives of Australians. Ultimately, I’m grateful I was paired with the NDIS as I really value the purpose, and values of the Agency.
The best part of the Graduate program was being able to explore different areas of the Agency. Throughout the program I worked in three different teams and got to experience numerous areas of the Agency through shadowing. This allowed me to be able to figure out where my interests lay and make connections, ultimately leading to the Health Liaison Officer role.
My advice for future NDIA Graduates is:
Don’t be afraid to reach out to people and explore the Agency. If you are interested in certain roles and want to shadow/learn more, don’t hesitate to discuss with your line manager or reach out to other graduates.
Make the most of the opportunities that come with a graduate program. Volunteer to run meetings, join working groups, pursue rotations/teams you are interested in.
Make new friends and connect with others! I’ve made some great friendships across the graduate program including people based in Sydney and across the country.
Rik Saunders
The Graduate Program is a fantastic way to begin your professional career. The rotations provide an opportunity to experience working across different teams gives you a well-rounded understanding of your department. This not only connects you to many people across your department but also fellow graduates working in departments outside of your own.
Currently I’m working for the assets team within The Financial Reporting Team. My role is busy and there is something different to do every day. There is a monthly cycle to the nature of financial reporting which gives you an opportunity to refine your understanding and hone your processes across the course of the year and when I’m not counting beans, you’ll find me listening to music. I’m deeply passionate about songwriting and the therapeutic benefits of keeping a musical practise.
My advice for future NDIA Graduates is:
Never be afraid to ask your team how you can help.
Take time to get to know your colleagues.
Spend time understanding the purpose of the Agency and the outcomes it strives to achieve.
Amanda Garland
I have a strong understanding of the difference the NDIS makes, as my brother lives with intellectual disability and autism. We were raised in public housing and experienced the double challenge of a piecemeal disability system, that wasn’t easy to navigate for people already doing it tough.
During my Master of Social Work I completed units in social policy and disability practice. My lived experience and time at university sparked a dream of making a difference at the NDIA.
In 2019, while working away at my final placement, I got a lifechanging call. I was going to be a 2020 NDIA Graduate. Four years on I am a Guidance Lead. I have the privilege of translating NDIS laws into accessible guidance for staff and community.
The NDIA Graduate Program provided a pathway to where I am today. It helped me gain skills, experience and exposure needed for an impactful Australian Public Service (APS) career.
That is skills in applying for APS jobs, managing government projects and human-centred leadership, experience across the NDIA in service delivery, legal case management and service design as well as exposure to peers, leaders and projects across the APS.
My advice for future NDIA graduates is:
Give things a go. Talk to that person you admire; speak up at a meeting; test out a new way of doing something, reflect on your progress.
Trust yourself. Collaborate with your colleagues, share your innovative ideas, and know that you will bounce back from any challenges or setbacks you face.
Be kind to yourself. You are entering a new chapter of your life, treat yourself with the same kindness you would a friend.
James Tyrrell
I have a Bachelor of Economics and Finance from Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and joined the Graduate program through the Finance stream. Prior to starting at the NDIA, I did not know which specific finance area I wanted to pursue. Since then, I completed six rotations across the Finance division and have been exposed to new and exciting areas. I have just been placed in a full-time role of my choosing and could not be more excited to start in the Scheme Reporting team!
The biggest program benefit has been the exposure to various areas of the Finance division, and networking with many talented individuals. In addition to this, the Agency supports further study, such as the Charted Accounting program, which is a great motivator to learn new skills.
My advice for future NDIA Graduates is:
1.    Never stop learning.
2.    Invest in relationships.
3.    Utilise your networks.
Nicholas Dean
I am a Costings Officer in the Chief Financial Officer Division, and my job is to assist New Policy Proposal (NPP). This involves working with stakeholders to determine the anticipated financial costs of certain policy ideas, which are then considered by the Expenditure Review Committee of Cabinet. NPPs can come from a variety of sources and can touch on all aspects of the Agency, so there is always something new and interesting on my desk.
The ability to play a part in shaping an Agency that will have a tangible impact on the lives of Australians living with disability was a major drawcard to working here. The Graduate program gave me credits for a Master in Public Policy. I am currently studying part time at the Australian National University which would have been much more difficult at another Agency or company.
The Agency is really supportive of me pursuing further education.
My advice for future NDIA Graduates is:
1.    Embrace challenges.
2.    Ask lots of questions.
3.    You get out what you put in.
Nathan Petrovski
The NDIA Graduate program attracted me because I love being able to develop my skills and apply my knowledge in aid of giving Australians living with disability a better life. It is an endlessly motivating purpose. The Agency holds such a unique and important role in our country, the prospect of being part of its inception and growth was exciting to me. I get to solve problems that are often faced for the first time as the Agency is so young. The issues that often arise do not have an established history or process for being rectified, which is where we get to have lasting impacts in our solutions.
As part of the Graduate program, I completed six rotations within the Finance stream. Since completing the Graduate program, I’m now working as a Finance Officer.
The best part of the program is working on a multidisciplinary project aimed at improving the representation of leaders living with disability. The project allowed me to meet a range of different stakeholders in the disability community and subsequently increased my understanding on the importance and value that is provided to our society by individuals living with a disability.
My advice for future NDIA graduates is:
1.       Be open-minded.
2.       Be enthusiastic for work.
3.       Be willing to learn.

Corporate Plan 2024–2025
The NDIA Corporate Plan 2024–2025 is the Agency’s most significant planning document. It describes the Agency’s strategic direction for the next four years. It details the key activities we plan to carry out and how we will measure our performance. The 2024-25 Corporate plan was first uploaded 30 August 2024 and has been revised effective from 1 April 2025.

Corporate Plan 2024–2025 Easy Read (DOCX 76KB)
We recommend people using screen readers use Adobe Acrobat Pro or NVDA.
Revisions and governance
We review and update our Corporate Plan by 31 August each year, for the next four-year period. Before 2024, the title of our Corporate Plans included the four-year time frame (Corporate Plan 2023–2027).
From 2024, the title will include the current financial year only (Corporate Plan 2024–2025). This change has been made to improve readability and accessibility.
The Corporate Plan has been developed in line with government expectations and informed by reviews of key metrics, performance standards and analysis of current issues.
The NDIA Corporate Plan 2024–2025 includes a new strategic direction and updated outcome statement. The NDIA established its previous strategic direction in 2013, when the NDIS first began. At the time, the objective of the Agency was to implement the NDIS nationally.
The strategic direction has now been updated in recognition of the achievement of the NDIS national rollout. Key performance measures for the NDIA have also been adjusted to align with the new outcome statement.
It meets the requirements under s 177(1) of the
National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013
and s 35 of the
Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013
.
Of fundamental importance to our Corporate Plan are our Participant Service Charter and Participant Service Improvement Plan.
Participant Service Charter
The
Participant Service Charter
shows how we will work with and support participants, and explains what participants, their families and carers can expect when they deal with us.
The Participant Service Charter is based on five engagement principles:
transparent
responsive
respectful
empowering
connected.
It also includes new timeframes, called our Participant Service Guarantee.
This sets timeframes for the Agency to make decisions about access, plan approvals, implementation, plan reviews and nominee changes.
Participant Service Improvement Plan
The
Participant Service Improvement Plan
shows the practical activities and changes we’re committed to delivering to ensure the NDIS works better for everyone.

The quarterly reports provide the disability ministers with information (including statistics) about participants in each jurisdiction and the funding or provision of supports by the NDIA in each jurisdiction.
The NDIA provides these reports to disability ministers within 42 days of the end of each quarter.
Following consideration by the NDIA Board, the quarterly reports are made available here within 45 days of the end of each quarter.
Note: there have been some minor amendments to the versions of these reports provided to the NDIA Board to de-identify personal data within small population figures.

This page provides you with a number of ways to access documents and information that we hold.The fastest ways to access documents are at the top of the page.
myplace portal
You can get your personal information straight away through the NDIS participant portal which is called myplace. It’s a secure way for you to view the information we hold when it suits you. Your current NDIS plan is stored on your myplace.
If you need help to set-up your access to myplace, you can
contact us
.
Read more about
myplace
.
National Contact Centre
You can contact our
National Contact Centre
to get copies of letters that have already been sent to you. This includes your access decision letter and planning letters. The National Contact Centre accepts calls, emails and live webchats.
Read more about the
National Contact Centre
.
Explanation of decision letters
If you don’t understand why we made an access, planning or internal review decision, you can ask the staff member to write an explanation of decision letter. This letter will explain the reasons for their decision in more details. The staff member who made the decision can call you to explain it over the phone.
To ask for an explanation of decision letter, you can email
[email protected]
or contact us.
Participant Information Access (PIA)
You can get certain information we hold about you through our Participant Information Access (PIA) scheme. NDIS participants and their authorised representatives can request documents through the PIA
online webform
. The webform lists all the documents we can release through PIA. If you can’t use the webform, you can email PIA team or call the
National Contact Centre
to get help to make a request.
Read more about
Participant Information Access
.
Compensation matters
If you are a lawyer or an insurer involved in a participant’s compensation matter, you can contact our
Compensation Recoveries Branch directly
. If you can demonstrate you have the authority to act on behalf of the participant, the Compensation team can share certain documents with you.
Read more about
accessing information for Compensation matters
.
Subpoenas and summons
The NDIS Act does not generally allow the NDIA to comply with a subpoena, summons or other coercive notice from a court or tribunal, except in limited circumstances.
If you want to issue a subpoena or a summons, please
contact us
first.
For more information, including details about alternate ways the NDIA might be able to disclose information and where to serve a court order, visit
our subpoena page
.
Information Publication Scheme
We publish a wide range of information about the NDIA on our website. This includes our organisational structure, information about senior staff, and all our
monthly
,
quarterly
and
annual
reports. Our reports include data and statistics about NDIS participants and our decisions.
This is called our
Information Publication Scheme
.
Operating Guidelines
We publish all our operating guidelines on our website. Our guidelines explain what information we consider when we make decisions under the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). These guidelines are based on the NDIS Legislation and Rules.
Read more about our
our guidelines
.
Data and Research
We regularly publish data about participants, NDIS funding and disabilities on our Data and Research website. Anyone can download the datasets or use the interactive dashboard.
In some circumstances, we can release data may be released to external organisations, governments and individuals for the purpose of non-proprietary research.
Read more on our
Data and Research
website.
Sharing information with third parties
We sometimes receive requests for information about participants, prospective participants and providers from third parties like state and territory government agencies.
We can only release information about participants, prospective participants and providers when permitted by law, and usually with the consent of the person the information is about.
In some limited circumstances, permitted by law, we may disclose information about participants, prospective participants and providers to third parties without the consent of the person the information is about. For example, when the request is made for the purpose of law enforcement or child welfare.
All requests are considered by the NDIA on a case-by-case basis.
For more details, visit
Sharing participant information about participants, prospective participants and providers with third parties
.
Freedom of Information (FOI)
You can request any document that the NDIA holds under FOI (including your personal information). It may take 30 days to receive documents through FOI. But if you want to access a large number of documents or complex documents, it could take 60 to 90 days.
To make a request through FOI, you need to give us enough details about the documents you wish to access. We cannot search for documents if the wording you have used in your request is vague or non-specific. If you want help to make a clear FOI request, please
contact our FOI team.
While you can ask for your personal information under FOI, we encourage you to first make a request through
Participant Information Access (PIA).
This is often easier and simpler than making an FOI request.

Freedom of Information
.

It also provides guidance on how we collect, record, use and disclose protected Agency information, as well as the information handling considerations in situations where there is a serious threat to life, health or safety.

Vehicle modifications explained
When we talk about vehicle modifications, we mean changes to a vehicle so you can drive or travel in it. As always the changes need to address limitations on your ability to participate because of your disability.
You or a family member need to own the vehicle or have found a vehicle you plan to purchase or lease.
If you don’t own the vehicle, you’ll need to be able to use it regularly and have permission from its owner to modify it.
We’ll only consider vehicle modifications you need because of your disability.
Without these changes, you wouldn’t be able to drive the vehicle or travel as a passenger.
Vehicle modifications and driving supports are one way we help you to:
get to places you need to go and to the people you want to see
become as independent as possible
travel to work or activities
go somewhere on holiday.
To help you work with a vehicle modification assessor on evidence you need to give when requesting these supports, please use the
Vehicle modification assessment template DOCX 111KB)
.
If you want to know more about vehicle modification assessment or pricing, visit our
Providing assistive technology (AT) page

NDIS employment assistance
NDIS employment assistance enables a participant to successfully obtain or retain employment in the open or supported labour market.
This support can be delivered to any working age participant with an employment goal.
This may include supports to:
supplement work experience available through the school system
obtain part time work whilst finishing secondary education
transition from school into further education or training
explore what work means(discovery)
build essential foundation skills for work
manage complex barriers to obtaining and sustaining employment
implement specialised job customisation/job carving
obtain alternative employment following onset or exacerbation of disability
assist a person to change jobs
develop a career plan
obtain employment on completion of a qualification
transition from a supported employment service to open employment
successfully engage with an Inclusive Employment Australia provider or other employment service to secure employment and arrange ongoing support on the job if necessary.
NDIS and other employment programs
The NDIS is responsible for funding employment supports when a participant needs more intensive assistance than that available through general employment programs.
These programs, including Inclusive Employment Australia, are responsible for providing advice and support to:
individual jobseekers with disability to find and maintain employment, where the jobseeker has existing work skills and limited ongoing support needs.
encourage employers to hire and be inclusive of people with disability in the workplace (e.g. support, training and resources, financial assistance to help employers make reasonable adjustments, and incentives to hire people with disability, such as wage subsidies).
NDIS employment providers can work concurrently with an Inclusive Employment Australia provider for a period of time to help a participant find a suitable job. A joint plan needs to be developed that outlines the assistance each provider will deliver to ensure there are no gaps or overlaps in service.
Youth Employment Framework
The NDIS has a strong focus on practical intervention and work experience to build a young person's skills, confidence and readiness to engage in employment.
The NDIS Youth Employment Framework clearly outlines the capacity building employment supports available for young participants aged 15-24.
NDIS remains committed to assisting young people with difficulties in learning, social interaction and self-management to achieve employment on transitioning from school. The framework emphasises the importance of providing appropriate assistance to this group of participants as well as stressing the value of earlier intervention.
Young people of working age to build skills while still at school through supplementary work experience to complement what is available through the school curriculum and/or support to find and maintain a part-time job outside of school hours.
Young people who are transitioning from school to employment with functional impacts in the areas of learning, social interaction, and self-management, who require intensive assistance to build skills to transition from school to work.
Young people (20-24 years) with minimal work experience and no previous employment history with functional impacts in the areas of learning, social interaction, and self-management, who require intensive support to build their capacity to work.
Young people who require support to transition from school to tertiary education or training. Or obtain employment on a completion of a qualification. Smooth path to tertiary education/training and job using qualifications.
At school and thinking about work?
Participants can start preparing for work after they leave school by doing extra work experience or getting a part-time job.
Employment assistance can help with building skills for work if a student’s disability means they need extra help. Skills include:
using public transport
managing money
working in a team
doing a job.
Work experience is part of the school curriculum and the responsibility of the school. NDIS may be able to help with extra support a participant needs because of their disability.
NDIS does not fund supports that are the responsibility of an employer, school or training provider but may fund extra disability related supports a participant needs to complete a VET course or school-based traineeship.
Participants can use their
community participation
funding to build skills and take steps toward employment. A community participation provider can help a participant:
learn to use public transport
improve communication
meet people and connect into the community
find new interests and skills
work well in a team.
Gaining confidence in these areas can be the first steps towards employment.
Are you a Year 12 student or leaving school?
Leaving school is a big step. When a participant is leaving school, they might need help to build their skills and be ready for work.
Young people with difficulties in learning, social interaction and self-management require individualised attention to explore work opportunities and to plan a pathway to employment. Each person’s needs will be different, but the activities listed below are essential for success in employment:
money handling
time management
communication and interpersonal skills
using public transport
problem solving and decision making
identifying work preferences
on the job work experience
job customisation
employer connection and education
assistance to get a job
coaching to learn a job
continuing support to maintain employment (when required).
NDIA works with education providers to enable students with disability to make a smooth transition from school to employment or further education. Employment outcomes are optimised when students, parents and teachers commence planning early and not wait until the end of school to consider employment pathways.
Participants can speak to their school about the information and connections they can provide to develop a career transition plan. A participant can use the transition plan in conversations with their local area coordinator or planner to ensure the right supports to move from school to work are included in their NDIS plan.
Thinking about further study or training after school?
Tertiary education or vocational training is a common pathway to work, and necessary for many jobs.
Employment assistance is available to participants who require extra help to make the right connections at TAFE or university.
The NDIS does not fund what TAFE or university are responsible for but can assist participants to access and successfully engage in further education or training. This might include:
personal care whilst studying or undertaking approved placements
transport if unable to drive or use public transport, because of their disability
training for staff at university, TAFE or host employer (during placements) about individual support needs.
Employment assistance is also available to enable participants to obtain suitable employment after they qualify.
Not yet working but want to work?
Some participants were not ready for work when they first left school.
Others received employment services outside of NDIS or even tried work without success. It is never too late to start planning to work.
Employment assistance is available to help participants build skills for work, gain experience, and find a job that is right for them. The NDIS provides more intensive assistance than employment programs such as inclusive Employment Australia.
Employment related assessment, counselling and advice may benefit participants who have limited work experience to identify barriers to employment and inform a work goal and employment development plan. This can inform adjustments to work processes or workplaces (job customisation) that enable a participant to be productive and safe at work.
Volunteering
Volunteering is unpaid work. It can be a great first step to getting paid work.
Being a volunteer has lots of benefits. It can help participants gain work experience in a field of interest and can increase work skills and general wellbeing.
Volunteering can build important personal and work relationships as well as having a positive impact on the community.
Participants can speak to their LAC or support coordinator about opportunities to volunteer in their area. They can speak to their planner about the support they need to participate.
Work goals and NDIS plans
A planning meeting is a chance for participants to talk to their Local Area Coordinator or NDIS Planner about their work goals, and any barriers they faced in finding or keeping a job.
The
Let's talk about work
booklet can help participants prepare for a conversation about their work goals and how NDIS can help.
Finding employment service providers
When a participant receives their approved plan, it’s time to choose an employment provider.
The
Provider finder
has information about where employment providers deliver services.
Local area or support coordinators can also help find suitable providers.
Provider comparison worksheet
Questions to ask a provider and compare services offered are on the provider comparison worksheet.

Provider reporting and outcomes
Providers who deliver employment assistance to participants moving from school to work report to the Agency on their services and outcomes they achieved.
The NDIA publishes the
Provider quarterly report - School leaver employment
to highlight what helps participants find and keep a job.
Participants can discuss these results with providers and enquire how the provider will help them to reach their own work goals.
Visit
Outcomes by provider
to view individual provider results.
What to expect from a provider
Providers work with participants to tailor activities that meet their unique needs.
Employment assistance is intended to assist a participant to prepare for, find and keep a job matched to their abilities and interests whilst meeting the job requirements of the employer.
Providers are expected to develop a Service Agreement with the participant which details agreed outcomes, a schedule of activities, and when progress will be reviewed and necessary adjustments made.

7 - Our Guideline
There are many reasons why a person might choose to leave the NDIS:
You don’t want to be a participant anymore and choose to leave
You move permanently into residential aged care
You start to get help at home from the aged care services
You’re no longer eligible.
Participants also leave the NDIS when they die. Learn more about what to do when someone dies.
What if you don’t want to be an NDIS participant anymore?
You can choose to leave the NDIS at any time, if you no longer want to be a participant.
This might be because you met your goals or have developed your skills and independence, and don’t need the NDIS anymore.
What do you need to consider?
If you choose to leave, just remember:
Your plan ends on the day you let us know in writing that you wish to leave.
You can’t use your NDIS funding once you let us know you wish to leave.
You’ll no longer be an NDIS participant.
If you want to become a participant again, you’ll need to reapply. If you reapply, there’s no guarantee you’ll become a participant again as you'll need to meet all the eligibility requirements.
Remember, to be eligible for the NDIS, you must be younger than 65 on the day you apply. If you’re turning 65 soon and want to apply again after you leave, contact us so we can help you apply on time.
Let us know if you want to leave
If you want to leave, you or your authorised representative must let us know in writing. Verbal requests are not accepted. The easiest way to let us know is by completing the:
Leaving the NDIS form (DOCX 72KB
)
Once completed, there are a few ways you can return the form to us:
Email the form to
[email protected]
Mail the form to NDIA, GPO Box 700, Canberra ACT 2601
In person, by visiting an Early Childhood Partner, Local Area Coordinator or NDIS office in your area.
What if you move into residential aged care?
You must leave the NDIS if you move into a residential aged care service permanently for the first time after you turn 65, or if you start getting home care services permanently for the first time after you turn 65.
When we say aged care services, we mean services funded by the Department of Health’s Aged Care system. This includes residential aged care and home care services.
The supports you get in residential aged care can be different from NDIS supports outside aged care facilities.
Find out more about residential aged care services on the
Department of Health website.
Are you still eligible for the NDIS?
You’re no longer eligible for the NDIS if:
You don’t live in Australia anymore
You are no longer an Australian citizen, permanent resident, or hold a special category visa that is protected, or
You no longer meet the disability or early intervention requirements.
If a person has entered, via early intervention requirements, their eligibility may be checked at each plan change.
This is a normal part of an NDIS journey. If we need more information, we’ll let you know.
Participants with a developmental delay must leave the NDIS when they turn six, unless they have evidence of a permanent impairment that meets the disability or early intervention requirements.
Before their child turns six, we’ll contact their family or authorised representative and explain what information we need to decide if their child is still eligible and what they will need to do if they leave the NDIS.
Children transitioning from the NDIS
For some children younger than 7 years of age, we may determine that early intervention supports have improved a child’s capacity and independence, therefore decreasing their need for ongoing NDIS supports.
This may mean some children have achieved their goals and no longer need NDIS support.
If this happens, the early childhood partner will work with the child and their family to support them to connect with mainstream and community supports.
Some children may require ongoing support and, if this happens, the early childhood partner will work with us to determine if the child meets the disability requirements.

Assistance animals explained
Some NDIS participants use assistance animals (most commonly dog guides) as a disability support.
Before funding an assistance animal, the NDIA will consider whether an assistance animal is a reasonable and necessary support that will meet your needs and help you pursue your goals.
To consider if an assistance animal is a reasonable and necessary support, the NDIA requires evidence in writing with input from all of the following:
a registered assistance animal provider
allied health professional(s)
the participant.
Generally, the NDIA will only fund an assistance animal which has passed, or will pass, your state or territory’s Public Access Test. This ensures that the animal is suitable to accompany and support you as you participate in the community.
Related funding
If an assistance animal is included in your NDIS plan, funding may also be provided for necessary training of the animal and its handler, as well the extra maintenance costs of an assistance animal (over those of an equivalent companion animal or pet).
For further detail please refer to the
updated guideline
on assistance animals including dog guides:
We’ve also updated the
Would we fund it guide
to clarify how assistance animals, therapy animals and pets and companion animals are funded:
Would we fund it guide – Assistance animals
Would we fund it guide – Therapy animals
Would we fund it guide – Pets and companion animals
.
Research and resources
A 2019 study clarified the key terms for animals in disability assistance roles. It also assessed the evidence relating to NDIS participant trained assistance dogs.

"I am asking for this information for research purposes as part of an academic study examining new market creation, entrants and exits to the new market, etc.
I am seeking to tie individual providers to the services they provide, their location, their organizational type, and their date of registration with NDIS. I have already checked the provider lists provided elsewhere on the NDIS website (most recent versions updated 18 February 2016) and they do not provide information on the characteristics and market profile presented in two other locations in summary form.
So fundamentally I am interested in knowing exactly which companies are represented in each group of characteristics, in other words a more granular level of data than is presented in the summary formats. For example, I am looking to distinguish the 1,875 newly-registered providers from the 342 previously-registered-with-DSS providers and the 584 Australian Private Companies from the 788 Individual/Sole Traders.
I am interested in receiving at least the most up-to-date version of this information. If this version includes information on when each of the providers registered with NDIS, then I will only need this most up-to-date version. If the quarterly table or public market dashboard raw data does not include the date of registration for each of the providers, then I would like to request that specific piece of information as well."

However, the Standard Operating Procedures do not contain information designed to assist the National Disability Insurance Agency to perform or exercise the Agency’s functions or powers in making decisions or recommendations – that information is contained in the Operational Guidelines (

The section on ‘Protected participants’ (page 49) reflects only an additional manual data-handling procedure for a class of participants. This procedure is a reasonable and necessary internal procedure to protect the personal information of certain participants, in addition to the normal information protection mechanisms the Agency adheres to for all participants. It reflects the implementation of a recommendation of the Agency’s Privacy Impact Assessment, which states: Develop a mechanism for ‘flagging’ clients who are at higher risk of a privacy breach (eg NDIS staff, public figures, self-nominated victims of violence). For this category, restrict views to senior NDIS managers, and conduct proactive monitoring of the audit logs on their records. For the avoidance of doubt, protected participants go through the same processes as any other prospective participant.

Home modifications explained
Home modifications are custom-built changes to your home to help you access and use areas of your home.
You may need home modifications if you:
have safety concerns or difficulty moving around your home
have trouble with personal care, like using your shower
can’t use the rooms you need to use in your home
have difficulty achieving your goals in your home because of your disability
need changes to your home so your carers can support you safely.
Home modifications can be minor changes or they can be complex.
As with any building work, there are laws and regulations that need to be adhered to when undertaking home modifications under the Scheme.
Minor home modifications
Minor home modifications (MHM) are home modifications that don’t change the structural parts of the home or cost no more than $20,000. We will need an assessment from a
suitably qualified occupational therapist
on what changes to your home you need.
There are 2 categories of minor home modification:
Category A minor home modifications cost under $10,000
Category B minor home modifications cost between $10,000 and $20,000, or they involve minor modifications to a bathroom floor.
These are funded using a set NDIS budget based on current market costs in MMM1 locations using the Modified Monash Model (MMM).
For example, widening an internal doorway that isn’t holding up other parts of the home is likely to be a category A minor home modification.

NDIS Minor Home Mods

Complex home modifications
Complex home modifications (CHM) are changes that may involve a few areas in your home. For example, you might need to combine your bathroom and toilet to give you more room to use a hoist or shower chair.
An experienced and/or qualified
home modification assessor
(specially qualified occupational therapist) must assess your needs at home and certify the effectiveness of the modification to meet your goals and likely future needs, during planning and on completion of the works.
The NDIA will provide funding for a building construction practitioner to work with the participant and
home modification assessor
to help with planning the recommended scope of works. They can assist participants with the review and appointment of builders, or other suppliers in consultation with the participant.
The NDIA will provide funding for participants to engage a building works project manager for complex home modifications, particularly where it involves high risk or cost. The building works project manager must be independent of any builders who quote for the job.
The NDIA may also fund an independent building certifier, if required.
View
Our Guideline – Home modifications
to find out more.
The NDIA has published a
Home modifications guide for builders and designers
to provide technical information and guidance about the scope of works the NDIA will typically approve with assessments and quotes for home modifications.
Related or incidental funding
In some circumstances, the NDIA may fund reasonable and necessary supports that are related or incidental to home modifications.
For example short term rent if you need to move out of your home during building works.
The NDIA will generally fund standard modifications and fittings.
You may opt to use your own money to contribute to a more expensive finish or fixture that achieves the same or equivalent outcome as the supports in your NDIS plan.
For example, a participant funded for a standard vanity unit may prefer a more expensive finish.
In this example the participant pays any additional cost to have the vanity upgraded to their preferred finish.
Contracts or service agreements for home modification services
Contracts or service agreements are particularly important when getting advice/specifications for a home modification and with the provider(s) you choose to do your home modifications. These agreements can help you if there are disputes or problems during (or after) the process.
When you engage a provider to develop drawings, plans or other documents for your planned home modifications, the provider is likely to ask you to sign a contract or terms and conditions (T&C) document for that work. The contract (or T&C) may include who owns the intellectual property rights (IPR) in the drawings, plans or documents. This may provide rights for you or other people you engage to use the drawings, plans or other documents (known as an intellectual property licence).
The ownership and restrictions on the use of the IPR in the drawings, plans or other documents may impact how you can use those documents, such as limiting your ability to provide these to  someone else to use to build your modifications.
Before signing the contract, you should consider if the IPR ownership and use meet your needs.
More information on IPR is on the
Who Owns Intellectual Property
page of the IP Australia website.
If you need help understanding or negotiating any agreement with a provider, you may consider using the Disability Gateway to find a legal service provider that can help you.
The
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission website
has resources to help NDIS participants understand these rights. This includes
Your consumer rights – A guide for consumers with disability
and
a publication list of disability resources
.

The NDIS works with suitably experienced and qualified partner organisations to deliver local area coordination and the early childhood approach to Australians with disability, including children with developmental delay. They are the face of the NDIS in the community.
If you are between the ages of 9 and 64 years of age, call the local area coordination partner in your local government area. They will be your main contact point for the NDIS.
If you have a child younger than 6 with developmental delay or younger than 9 with disability, call the early childhood partner in your local government area.
The early childhood partner will be your main contact point for the NDIS and will help you understand and access the most appropriate
supports for your child

Protecting the NDIS brand
The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) and its brand.
This includes identifying and taking action in response to any misuse of the NDIS logo, the NDIS acronym or other trade marks registered in the NDIA’s name.
Trade marks are a form of legal protection for a business name and other elements of your brand. For more information about trademarks visit
What Are Trade Marks? IP Australia
In addition to monitoring use of the NDIS name and logos, the NDIA monitors the provider marketplace to identify business practices that may, by falsely suggesting an affiliation with the NDIS, amount to misleading or deceptive conduct under the
Australian Consumer Law
. Providers engaging in such practices will be reported to the
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)
for further action.
This page outlines:
who is authorised to use NDIS logos and the NDIS acronym
the consequences of misusing NDIS logos and the NDIS acronym
the type of provider conduct that the NDIA will report to the
ACCC
.
NDIS logo use
The NDIS logo and acronym are registered trade marks in the NDIA’s name.
No provider, person or business is permitted to use the NDIS logo without written consent from the NDIA. This includes use of the NDIS logo on publicity materials, advertising, vehicles, buildings, emails, stationery and business cards.
Use of logos by providers
Only registered NDIS providers are permitted to use the ‘I/we heart NDIS’ and ‘I/we support NDIS’ logos with the tagline, ‘Registered Provider’.
A registered NDIS provider is a person or organisation that is registered with the
NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission
in accordance with section
73E of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013
.
The full list of registered NDIS providers can be found on the
provider finder page
.
'Registered provider' tagline pack (2.8MB)
- includes .JPG, .EPS print quality and .SVG files.
'I heart NDIS with Registered provider tagline' pack (2.1MB)
- includes .JPG, .EPS print quality files.
'We heart NDIS with Registered provider tagline' pack (2.1MB)
- includes .JPG, .EPS print quality files.
Unregistered NDIS providers are not permitted to use the ‘I/we heart NDIS’ and ‘I/we support NDIS’ logos with the tagline, ‘Registered Provider’.
Use of the statement ‘registered provider’
You may only advertise your business as a ‘registered provider’ if it is registered with the
NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission
in accordance with section 73E of the NDIS Act.
If you are not a registered NDIS provider, you must not advertise or pass yourself off as a ‘registered provider’ or use other language (for example, ‘official NDIS provider’), which falsely implies you are registered.
Statements of affiliation
You must not suggest an affiliation or relationship with the NDIA or NDIS where no such relationship exists.
The NDIA understands there are times when providers may need to use the NDIS acronym, and other words or acronyms over which the NDIA may own intellectual property rights, in a descriptive sense. However, this must not be done in a way that infringes the NDIA’s intellectual property or could cause confusion or be misleading to members of the public.
Examples of misleading statements of affiliation include use of the NDIS acronym in business names, trading names or domain names, and use of the NDIS acronym in the name of a product or service such as ‘NDIS packages’ or ‘NDIS bundles’.
Positioning of goods or services
Providers should not make broad statements that may be confusing or lead NDIS participants to incorrectly assume they can pay for the costs of a product or service under their NDIS plan when this may not be the case.
It is not correct to state or imply that particular goods or services will, in all cases, be covered by the NDIS, or that NDIS funding is 'guaranteed’.
Accordingly, when advertising goods or services, providers should refrain from:
using statements such as ‘NDIS approved’ or ‘100% NDIS funded’
using the ‘I heart NDIS’ logo or ‘we support NDIS’ logos to indicate your product or service is funded by the NDIS. Such activity may mislead participants into claiming for supports that are not covered by their NDIS plan.
Actions we take
The NDIA is committed to ensuring that NDIS participants receive accurate information in the marketplace.
The NDIA continues to monitor the marketplace for trade mark infringement and provider practices that may be in breach of
Australian Consumer Law
.
The NDIA takes infringement action against providers found to be misusing the NDIS logos or NDIS acronym. This includes issuing cease-and-desist letters and taking further legal action when warranted.
The NDIA also reports any potential breaches of the
Australian Consumer Law
to the
ACCC
for further investigation and action.

The National Disability Insurance Scheme was established under the
National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 (NDIS Act)
.
The national scheme has funding and governance shared among all governments. All Australian governments are involved in decisions relating to the scheme’s policy, funding and governance.
The
Commonwealth Minister
is responsible for administering the NDIS Act, and exercises statutory powers with the agreement of states and territories, including a power to make the NDIS Rules and direct the NDIA.
The
Disability Reform Ministerial Council
is the decision-maker on NDIS policy issues. It’s made up of Ministers responsible for disability from the Commonwealth, states and territories.
The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) administers the scheme. It is governed by a Board.
The NDIA Board is advised by the
Independent Advisory Council
.
The NDIA holds all funds contributed by the Commonwealth, states and territories in a single pool, manages scheme funds, administers access to the scheme and approves the payment of individualised support packages.

Sometimes your plan might need to change. This page explains when and how you can request changes to your plan.
Changes to our language
We want to make it easier for you to talk to us about making changes to your plan.
You have told us that the ways we have been talking about ‘reviews’ is confusing.
As part of changes to the NDIS Act that come into effect from 1 July 2022, we are changing some of the words we use.
As a participants or authorised representative, you have the right to ask us to ‘vary’ or ‘reassess’ your plan.
If you are not happy with your plan, you can still ask us to review our decision.
We will continue to respond to these requests using the legislation and in line with our
Participant Service Charter
.
If you are not sure which of these words is relevant to your situation, we will talk to you more broadly about your plan and what ‘changes’ you want to make.
Sometimes, you might not need any changes, but just more help to implement your plan.
Other times, we might be able to vary your plan without doing a full reassessment or replacing it with a new one.
In each instance, we will work with you to make those changes and you will receive a letter explaining our decision.
You can read more about this in our guideline on
changing your plan.
When requesting a plan change reassessment, you must provide clear evidence. This includes detailed documentation that supports your need for a reassessment, such as:
medical reports
therapy assessments
recommendations from healthcare professionals.
The words we use now
What we call it
What we used to call it
What it means for you
Reassessment date of a participant’s plan
Review date of a participant’s plan
End date of a participant’s plan
Every NDIS plan includes a ‘reassessment date’.
We need to look at the plan with you by this date and decide if any changes are needed.
If a plan reaches its reassessment date before the reassessment is completed, the current plan will be varied to extend it by 12 months so you can continue accessing supports.
Plan reassessment (Participant or Agency initiated)
(Full) plan review
Scheduled or unscheduled review
Change of Circumstances (CoC) review
S48 review
You can ask for a reassessment at any time.
When we conduct a reassessment, we can decide to create a new plan or vary the current plan, depending on your situation.
You can read more about plan reassessments below
Plan variation
‘Light touch’ plan review
Plan extension, rollover or continuation
New plans with similar supports and new plans with minor changes
Under the NDIS Act, there are some situations where we can ‘vary’ a plan without a full reassessment.
You can ask for a variation at any time.
If we do a variation, you will receive a copy of the varied plan within 7 days.
Internal review of decision
S100 review
Review of reviewable decision (RORD)
Participants can ask for a review of our decisions.
If a participant is not happy with the outcome of this review, they can also ask the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review our decision.
Participant check-ins
We will continue using check-ins as a way to support you in using your plan.
We introduced participant check-ins as part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic to make sure that you could continue to get the supports you needed.
We have decided to keep them because you have told us that you like having the chance to talk to us about how your plan is working for you.
The participant check-in focuses on talking to you about your current situation, checking on your wellbeing and making sure your NDIS supports and other supports are meeting your needs.
Find out
what to expect from a participant check-in
.
Find more resources about changing your plan in accessible formats on the
booklets and factsheets page
.
Your first NDIS plan reassessment usually falls 12 months after your plan started.
We will check in with you before your reassessment date.
If you haven't heard from us six weeks prior, call us on 1800 800 110 or
find and call your nearest office
.
Find more resources about check-ins in accessible formats on the
booklets and factsheets page
.
Plan reassessments
We will normally contact participants or your authorised representatives 3 months before a plan reassessment is due and confirm details.
During the check-in, we will talk to you about booking in a plan reassessment meeting. We will also talk to you about what information you may need to provide at the meeting.
This might include assessments or reports from service providers to show how they are helping you work toward your plan goals.
You can have a plan reassessment meeting face-to-face, over the phone, or video call.
You will also have the option to invite supports along to the meeting, such as a family member, friend, or Support Coordinator.
You might also want to think about what you want to talk about at the plan reassessment meeting.
This might include:
What worked well in your plan?
What goals did you achieve?
What didn’t work as well?
Do you have any questions about how your plan is managed?
Would you like to change how you manage your funding?
Do you have any new goals you would like in your next plan?
Have there been any changes to your situation?
Are you expecting any changes to your situation? (e.g. are you planning to leave school, start or leave work, or move out of home).
If you’re not expecting any changes to your situation soon, you can also talk to your Local Area Coordinator or Planner about whether you would like a longer plan.
Asking for a plan reassessment
If you need changes to your plan before the reassessment date, you can contact us at any time to ask us about making changes to your plan.
If you lodge a request for a plan change reassessment without clear evidence, it may be declined. To help the process, make sure you have your evidence ready before you make a request for a plan change reassessment.
If you have a change in circumstance requiring a change in your plan, and you have the evidence to support your request, you don’t have to worry – you will not be left with insufficient funds.
If you ask us to reassess your plan, we will respond within 21 days by:
Varying your plan (see below for more information on
plan variations
);
Replacing your plan with a new plan; or
Making a decision not to reassess your plan.
We will contact you with our decision and the reason for our decision.
If you are not happy with this decision, you can ask us to review that decision.
You can read more about
Our Guidelines – Reviewing our decisions
.
You must spend your NDIS funding within your approved plan and on supports that meet the reasonable and necessary criteria under the NDIS Act.
Overspending your budget before the end of your plan funding period is not, by itself, a valid reason for a reassessment. By using your NDIS funding efficiently and effectively, you ensure you have ongoing support for the length of your plan.
If you suspect any unethical practices by plan managers, support coordinators, or providers more broadly, report them through the
NDIA Fraud Reporting Form
or the
NDIS Commission website
.
Plan variations
In some situations, we may be able to make changes to your plan without a full plan reassessment.
Under the NDIS Act, we can only vary a plan:
To correct a minor or technical error.
To change the reassessment date of the plan.
If there needs to be a change to the statement of participant supports in relation to managing the funding for supports or other aspects of the plan.
To make a change to an existing stated support to reflect a different provider or manner of support provision.
If you require crisis or emergency funding as a result of a significant change to your support needs.
If we receive new information in response to a NDIA request for information that had previously been made (e.g., assistive technology or home modifications); or
If a minor variation is required to increase the funding of supports in the plan.
If you ask us to vary your plan, we will respond within 21 days by:
Deciding to vary your plan;
Deciding not to vary your plan; or
Letting you know that we need more time.
If we vary your plan, you will receive a copy of the varied plan within 7 days.
Temporary measures for plan variations
We have started work to upgrade our computer systems so that we can quickly and effectively deliver plan variations.
Until this upgrade is complete, participants who have their plan varied will receive a ‘new’ plan.
This plan will have:
A new start date (even though it’s a variation of the existing plan);
Funded supports adjusted in line with the reassessment date); and
A new reassessment date.
We will normally keep the new reassessment date as close as we can to the original reassessment date, but depending on your situation, we might work with you to put a longer plan in place.
Early childhood provider reports for children younger than 7
The NDIA requires providers working with children younger than 7 who are NDIS participants, to report on the services and supports they provide to you and your child.
Provider reports give you a written summary of the progress you and your child have made towards your goals and the outcomes achieved as a result of services and supports received.
Reports are also helpful when your child’s plan is being reassessed.
You can read more about plan reassessments in our guides – changing your plan.
We encourage you to speak with your provider(s) about
writing a report for your child
which can be provided to us at least annually.
You can talk to your provider(s) about including some funding in your plan for a report when setting up a service agreement with them.
Home and living supports
The NDIA may fund reasonable and necessary home and living supports, if they are unable to be met through mainstream, community, informal or other supports.
Participants can request these supports by completing the
Supporting Evidence Form – Home and Living
.
This form can be returned for consideration within 100 days of a plan reassessment, with a request for a plan reassessment, or with a request for a review of a decision.
You can read more about
Home and living supports
.
If your plan reaches its reassessment date
The NDIA has made changes to the NDIS myplace portal to make sure that participants are not left without services if there is a gap between their plan reassessment date and a reassessment being completed.
All plans that reach their reassessment date will be automatically varied to extend it by 12 months.
The NDIA has also made further improvements including:
Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) and Supported Independent Living (SIL) supports will have service bookings increased automatically where a plan has been varied to extend by 28 days.
Unclaimed funds within a participant’s previous plan and service bookings will be available for 90 days after it has been replaced by a new approved plan. This gives participants and providers more time to make payment requests for services delivered during the previous plan period.
This means participants can receive services regardless of a delay in the plan reassessment process. It also means providers can continue to claim for services while the participant prepares for a plan reassessment.
Letting your providers know
There will be an alert for participants in the NDIS myplace participant portal when a plan has been extended.
Check if your plan has been varied in the NDIS myplace participant portal and let your providers know the plan reassessment date has been extended, and they can continue to request payment for supports.
What will happen to my service bookings?
The system will make sure the service bookings that are due to end on your plan reassessment date do not end.
Will this affect the supports in my old plan?
We will make additional funding available in your NDIS plan if your plan is extended, except in the case of home modifications and assistive technology.
When you are purchasing supports, you need to make sure you are only spending NDIS funds on supports which have been described in your plan.
You can read more about
what supports you can buy with your NDIS funding
.
What happens when I try to claim payments after a new plan is place?
You can successfully make payment requests in the NDIS myplace portal for services delivered during the old plan period for up to 90 days after the new plan has been approved, if there are enough funds available.
You will see a message in service booking details in the NDIS myplace portal letting you know that unspent funds will remain available for 90 days after the reassessed plan is approved.

What is the Information Publication Scheme (IPS)?
The
Freedom of Information Act 1982
(FOI Act) establishes the Information Publication Scheme (IPS).
The IPS is a government-wide scheme, aiming to promote and achieve a pro-disclosure culture across government. It sits alongside agencies’ other obligations under the FOI Act including Part III (Access to documents) of the FOI Act.
The IPS is intended to form the basis for a more open and transparent culture across government, with agencies encouraged to take a proactive approach to publishing the information they hold, and to consider publishing information over and above what they are obliged to publish.
The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) is required to publish a range of information on its website as part of the IPS. This includes information on the NDIA’s structure, functions, appointments, annual reports, consultation arrangements, and contact details of the NDIA’s freedom of information (FOI) officer(s). Information routinely released through FOI requests and routinely provided to Parliament must also be published online. Together, this information forms part of the NDIA’s ‘IPS entry’ and is set out below under the heading ‘Information required to be published under the IPS’.
Who regulates the IPS?
The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) is responsible for overseeing the IPS for all Australian Government agencies that are subject to the FOI Act. Read more about
the IPS for Australian Government agencies
The NDIA's IPS entry
The NDIA is committed to taking a proactive approach to publishing information. Our
IPS Agency Plan
outlines our approach to the IPS and what we will include in our IPS entry. The information we will publish in our IPS entry is set out under headings in the ‘Required information under the IPS’ section below. Under each heading are links to the information or documents. If you have any difficulty accessing any information please contact us.
Information on requesting access to other information the NDIA holds, which is not published through the IPS or elsewhere on our website, can also be found on the
Access to information page
.
Information that we have released under FOI requests is available on our
FOI disclosure log
.
Information required to be published under the IPS
The NDIA is required under section 8(2) of the FOI Act to publish certain categories of specified information.
The publication of this information is set out below.
IPS Agency Plan
The NDIA is required under section 8(2)(a) of the FOI Act to publish the
NDIA’s IPS Agency Plan
.
The NDIA’s IPS Agency Plan sets out what information we will publish under the IPS, to whom we will make the information available, and what additional steps we will take to promote pro-disclosure and information sharing beyond our minimum IPS obligations.
Who we are
The NDIA is required under sections 8(2)(b) and 8(2)(d) of the FOI Act to publish information about the organisation and structure of the NDIA, the location of offices, governance arrangements, the senior management team and statutory appointments. This information is available on the pages set out below.
Our organisational structure
General information about us
Our governance arrangements
Information about careers with us
Information about our statutory appointments:
Chief Executive Officer of the NDIA
Members of the Board of the NDIA
Members of the Independent Advisory Council
Scheme Actuary and Reviewing Actuary
What we do
The NDIA is required under sections 8(2)(c) and 8(2)(j) of the FOI Act to publish a description of the functions and powers of the NDIA, and the rules, guidelines, practices and precedents relating to those functions and powers. This is known as operational information.
Functions of the NDIA (including decision-making powers)
Information on the statutory functions of the NDIA
(including decision-making powers).
Operational information
The NDIA’s
Operational Guidelines
set out the NDIA’s operational information, that is, the information held by the NDIA to assist it perform or exercise its functions or powers in making decisions or recommendations affecting members of the public (or any particular person or entity, or class of persons or entities).
Our reports and responses to Parliament
The NDIA is required under sections 8(2)(e) and 8(2)(h) of the FOI Act to publish annual reports laid before the Parliament, and other information routinely provided to the Parliament.
A link to our reports and responses to Parliament will be published on this website as that information becomes available.
For information about the NDIA in financial year 2012-2013, please refer to ‘DisabilityCare Australia’ in the index of the

Holstep Health transition
Holstep Health (formerly Merri Health) has decided to cease providing NDIS early childhood partner services in the Ovens Murray service area in north-east Victoria, later this year.
A restricted grant process is currently underway to identify a new early childhood partner.
Holstep Health will continue to provide support as an early childhood partner until a new partner is confirmed, and the transition completed.
Participants can continue to use all their support and services during this process, and their current NDIS plan will remain the same.
The NDIA will work with Holstep Health and the new partner to make sure there are no disruptions to partner services.
The NDIA would like to acknowledge Holstep Health for their dedication to delivering best practice support for children, their families and carers over the last eight years.

ماذا يمول NDIS ؟
إجراء الارتباطات
يمكن لـ NDIS دعم الأشخاص من ذوي الإعاقة، حتى لو لم يكونوا متلقي خدمة في NDIS.
إذا كان عمرك بين 9 و64 عامًا، فيمكننا ربطك بالخدمات والدعم في مجتمعك. نسمي هذا ارتباطات المجتمع.
إذا كنت بحاجة إلى دعمٍ لطفل أصغر من 9 سنوات، فيمكننا توفير
ارتباطات الطفولة المبكرة
. إذا كان عمرك 65 عامًا أو أكثر، يمكننا أن نقدم لك معلومات عن خدمات رعاية المسنين التي يمكن أن تدعمك.
للحصول على ارتباطات المجتمع أو ارتباطات الطفولة المبكرة، يمكنك:
التحدث إلى شخص ما في
مكتب NDIS
.
الاتصال بنا هاتفيًا على الرقم 110 800 1800.
الاتصال بخدمة الترجمة التحريرية والشفهية على الرقم 450 131 وطلب التحدث إلى NDIS.
لمزيد من المعلومات، يرجى زيارة
إجراء الارتباطات
.
التقدم بطلب للحصول على خدمات NDIS
ستتغير الطريقة التي تتقدم بها إلى NDIS.
إذا كنت مؤهلًا للحصول على خدمات NDIS، فسنساعدك في التقدم إلى NDIS.
للتقدم إلى NDIS، ستحتاج إلى «جهة اتصال NDIS الخاصة بي». جهة اتصال NDIS الخاصة بك هي جهة الاتصال الرئيسية لك ولعائلتك في NDIS.
سوف تقوم جهة الاتصال بما يلي:
تقديم معلومات حول NDIS.
مساعدك على فهم الدعم الذي يمكنك الحصول عليه.
دعمك للتقدم إلى NDIS.
يمكن أن تكون جهة اتصال NDIS الخاصة بك شريكًا في NDIS أو أحد موظفي الوكالة الوطنية للتأمين ضد الإعاقة (NDIA).
شركاء NDIS هم:
شركاء الطفولة المبكرة الذين يساعدون الأطفال الذين تقل أعمارهم عن 9 سنوات.
منسقو المنطقة المحلية الذين يساعدون الأشخاص من ذوي الإعاقة الذين تتراوح أعمارهم بين 9 و64 عامًا.
ستكون جهة اتصال NDIS الخاصة بك شخصًا في NDIA إذا:
.كنت تعيش في منطقة نائية في أستراليا
.كان لديك احتياجات دعم معقدة
.كنت شابًا في دور رعاية المسنين السكنية
.كنت في مستشفى أو في أحد مراكز العدالة
بعد التقدم بطلب إلى NDIS، سنتصل بك في غضون 21 يومًا لإعلامك بقرارنا. قد نطلب منك أيضًا مزيدًا من المعلومات.
إذا كنت مؤهلًا، ستصبح متلقي خدمة من NDIS. سنستخدم المعلومات التي شاركتها في طلبك لتطوير خطة NDIS الأولى.
وإذا لم تكن مؤهلًا، فسنشرح السبب. وسوف يساعدك شريك NDIS الخاص بك على التواصل مع الدعم في مجتمعك.
لإجراء ارتباطات مع الخدمات والدعم في مجتمعك، أو للتقدم بطلب للحصول على خدمات NDIS، يمكنك:
التحدث إلى شخص ما في
مكتب NDIS
.
الاتصال بنا هاتفيًا على الرقم 110 800 1800.
الاتصال بخدمة الترجمة التحريرية والشفهية على الرقم 450 131 وطلب التحدث إلى NDIS.
لمزيد من المعلومات يرجى زيارة
التقدم بطلب إلى NDIS
.
إنشاء خطتك
عندما تصبح مشاركًا في NDIS، ستتلقى خطة NDIS.
خطة NDIS هي وثيقة تحتوي على معلومات حول:
أنت وأهدافك.
الدعم الذي تحتاجه.
الدعم الذي ستدفع NDIS تكلفته.
ستتم دعوتك إلى
اجتماع وضع الخطة
مع مُخطِط NDIA الذي طور خطتك.
مُخطِط NDIA هو شخص:
يعمل في NDIA.
يقوم بإنشاء خطط NDIS جديدة.
يغير خطط NDIS.
يطور ميزانية خطة NDIS الخاصة بك.
في اجتماع وضع الخطة، سيتحدث مخطِط NDIA معك عن:
ميزانية الخطة
والدعم.
القرارات التي اتخذوها بشأن خطتك.
كيف تريد إدارة خطتك.
تسجيل مقدمي الخدمة لخطتك.
أية تغييرات تعتقد أن خطتك تحتاجها.
سنرسل لك نسخة من خطة NDIS الخاصة بك. يمكنك استخدام منصة متلقي خدمة NDIS الخاصة بي وتطبيق NDIS الخاص بي لإلقاء نظرة على خطتك.
إذا لم تكن لديك خطة في نظام الحاسوب الجديد، فيجب عليك الاستمرار في استخدام بوابة المشاركين في myplace لتقديم مطالبات الدفع.
جهة اتصال NDIS الخاصة بك هي أفضل شخص للتحدث معه إذا:
كان لديك أسئلة.
كنت تحتاج إلى الدعم عند التواصل مع NDIS.
يمكنك العثور على تفاصيل الاتصال الخاصة بجهة الاتصال في خطتك.
إذا كان لديك تمويل في خطتك لتنسيق الدعم أو خدمات مدرب التعافي، فيمكنك الحصول على مساعدة لاستخدام خطتك من خلال:
منسق الدعم - شخص يساعدك على تخطيط واستخدام الدعم الخاص بك.
مدرب التعافي - شخص يدعمك في صحتك النفسية.
بعد استلام خطة NDIS الخاصة بك، ستقدم جهة اتصال NDIS الخاصة بك
اجتماعًا لتنفيذ الخطة
لمساعدتك في استخدام خطتك.
ستقوم جهة اتصال
NDIS الخاصة بك بالتواصل معك مرة
واحدة في السنة لتسأل عن كيفية سير خطتك.
لمزيد من المعلومات، تفضل بزيارة قسمي
فهم خطتك
و
استخدام خطتك
على موقعنا.
تغيير خطتك
إذا كانت لديك تغييرات في حياتك تعني أنك بحاجة إلى دعم أكثر أو أقل أو مختلف، فيمكنك طلب تغيير خطتك في أي وقت.
هناك طريقتان لتغيير خطتك - تغيير الخطة أو إعادة تقييم الخطة.
تغيير الخطة هو تغيير بسيط لخطتك الحالية. إعادة تقييم الخطة هي عندما نستبدل خطتك بخطة أخرى جديدة.
يمكن لجهة اتصال NDIS الخاصة بك أو منسق الدعم أو مدرب التعافي شرح المعلومات والأدلة التي نحتاجها لاتخاذ قرار بشأن تغيير خطتك.
لمزيد من المعلومات، يرجى زيارة
تغيير خطتك
.
مزودي الخدمة خاصتي
لن تحتوي خطة NDIS الجديدة على
حجوزات خدمة
.
إذا كان لديك تمويل تديره NDIA أو سكن متخصص لذوي الاحتياجات الخاصة أو دعم المنزل والمعيشة أو دعم السلوك في خطتك، فأنت بحاجة إلى إخبارنا بمقدمي الخدمات الذين يقدمون لك الدعم حتى نتمكن من تسجيله في خطتك.
نسمي مقدمي الخدمة المسجلين في خطتك بـ «مزودي الخدمة خاصتي». يمكن لمقدمي الخدمة في خطتك تقديم مطالبات على خطة NDIS الخاصة بك عندما يقدمون لك الدعم.
تسجيل مقدمي الخدمة في خطتك يعني أننا لا نضطر إلى التحقق منك قبل أن ندفع لهم.
يمكنك تحديث مقدمي الخدمة أو تغييرهم في أي وقت.
لمزيد من المعلومات تفضل بزيارة
مزودي الخدمة خاصتي
.
الاتصال بـ NDIS
للحصول على مترجم تحريري أو شفهي مجاني، يرجى الاتصال على الرقم 450 131 وطلب التحدث إلى NDIS.
يمكن لجهة اتصال NDIS الخاصة بك أيضًا ترتيب مترجم شفهي عندما يلتقي بك أو يتحدث معك.
قد يكون مقدم الخدمة الخاص بك قادرًا أيضًا على تزويدك بمترجم شفهي عند مقابلته أو التحدث معه.
يمكنك أيضًا زيارة مكتب NDIS وطلب التحدث إلى مترجم شفهي. تعرف على أقرب مكتب NDIS لك على موقع
NDIS الإلكتروني
.

استراتيجية التنوع الثقافي واللغوي
قمنا بإعداد وتصميم استراتيجية التنوع الثقافي واللغوي (CALD)     2024    -    2028     (الاستراتيجية).
يعني التصميم المشترك أننا عملنا مع المشاركين والأصدقاء والعائلة ومقدمي الرعاية وموظفي NDIS ومجتمع الإعاقة وتعلمنا منهم.
لقد شاركنا في تصميم الاستراتيجية مع أكثر من 800 شخص من خلفيات CALD.
هذا هو التزامنا بتحسين NDIS حتى نتمكن من تلبية الاحتياجات الثقافية واللغوية لجميع المشاركين لدينا.
لمساعدتنا في تقديم الاستراتيجية، قمنا بتطوير خطة عمل وشاركنا في تصميمها.
وهي تحدد الخطوات المختلفة التي نحتاج إلى اتخاذها لتنفيذ الاستراتيجية. هناك 28 إجراءً لإكمالها.

If want to learn more about disability supports, including the NDIS, you can:
find out more about
disability supports
on our website
call us on 1800 800 110
connect with an
NDIS partner
.
If you contact us directly, we will connect you with an NDIS partner. If you are over 9 you will connect with a
local area coordinator
. For children younger than 9, you will be connected to an
early childhood partner
.
If you are in a remote or very remote area, live in an area without an NDIS partner, have complex support needs, or are in a
hospital
or
justice
setting, we will refer you to a person at the NDIA.
NDIS partners can help all people with disability, including NDIS participants, their families and carers to find the supports you need to be more independent and do more of the things you enjoy in your local area.
Community connections
Your NDIS partner can work with you to develop a
community connections plan
if you want one, even if you are not eligible for the NDIS.
Community connections are all about helping you find the supports you need in your local community. These supports are called
mainstream and community supports
.
Mainstream supports are the supports from other government funded services, like health, mental health and education.
Community supports are supports you can get through community organisations, like peer-to-peer and community-based groups, religious groups, and services from local councils.
Learning about and connecting with community supports generally happens over one or two meetings. For some people it may be a regular conversation they have with their NDIS partner. There is no limit to the number of times you can contact your NDIS partner.
Checking your identity
Your NDIS partner will ask for documents to
check your identity
when you first meet with them.
Checking your identity is one of the ways that we protect your privacy, by making sure we only discuss your information with the right people.
Your NDIS partner will also ask to check your identity documents if you are a child representative, nominee, or authorised representative.
Applying to the NDIS
If you think you are
eligible
and want to apply to become an NDIS participant, there are different ways to complete your NDIS application. You can choose the way that best suits you.
You can:
visit your local area coordinator or early childhood partner.
Your NDIS partner

NDIS Taskforce makes first arrest

18 October 2018
The Federal Government established the National NDIS Fraud Taskforce in July to tackle potential fraud against the National Disability Insurance Scheme.
Today we can announce that the taskforce has made a significant arrest.
A 34-year-old Victorian man has been charged for allegedly defrauding the NDIS of more than $400,000.
This week a joint team from the Taskforce including members of the Australian Federal Police (AFP), the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) and the Department of Human Services (DHS) executed a search warrant in the Melbourne suburb of Parkville.
Police seized a BMW 7 series limousine, a Toyota Hilux and designer clothing and jewellery believed to be purchased with the proceeds of the alleged fraud at the Parkville location where the man was arrested.
Police will allege that between July and August this year the man defrauded the NDIS of the funds and in so doing directly impacted the ability of over 200 NDIS participants to access ongoing support.
The Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton said the arrest and charges should serve as a warning to anyone seeking to defraud the NDIS.
"The establishment of this Taskforce was a strong and unequivocal warning to those who may try to commit serious fraud against the NDIS," Mr Dutton said.
Parallel to the investigation, the NDIA worked to contact participants impacted by the alleged fraud.
Minister for Families and Social Services, Paul Fletcher, said the Government was absolutely committed to ensuring the funding provided by Australian taxpayers went to supporting people with disability through the NDIS.
"Let this be a warning that we will continue to come down hard on anyone who thinks they can defraud the NDIS or other welfare agencies.
"The NDIA is ensuring that participants affected by this alleged fraud are having their funds reinstated in their plans."
Human Services and Digital Transformation Minister Michael Keenan said stealing from taxpayers is not a victimless crime.
"Fraud robs the Australian community of much needed funds that should be spent on essential services we all rely on."
"The staff from my department involved in the taskforce are experts in fraud detection and prevention and I commend them for the work they've done to bring about this arrest." Mr Keenan said.
The Fraud Taskforce is a multi-agency partnership between the Australian Federal Police (AFP), the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) and the Department of Human Services (DHS).
Anyone with information about suspected fraud involving the NDIS should contact the Fraud Hotline on 1 800 650 717.

NDIS now supporting close to 200,000 Australians

13 August 2018
As at 30 June 2018, there were 183,965 Australians being supported by the NDIS, representing a 13 per cent growth on previous quarter
54,802 participants or almost 1 in 3 had not received State/Territory or Commonwealth support before the NDIS.
183,965 Australians are now benefitting from the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), an increase of 13 per cent on the last quarter, according to the latest COAG NDIS Quarterly Report for 1 April 2018 to 30 June 2018.
The Report shows the positive impact the NDIS is having on people’s lives and details the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) progress in implementing the world leading Scheme, including:
91 per cent of parents/carers of NDIS participants aged 0 to before school consider the NDIS has helped with their child’s development
71 per cent of participants aged 25 and over indicated the NDIS has helped them with Daily Living Activities.
88 per cent of participants rate their experience with the NDIS as either ‘Good’ or ‘Very Good’.
The provider market has experienced substantial growth with 16,755 registered providers, representing a 17 per cent increase on last quarter.
NDIA CEO Robert De Luca said the NDIS was gaining momentum as it continued to roll out across Australia.
“The NDIS is now fully operational in New South Wales, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory with the first regions of Western Australia joining the NDIA administered Scheme on July 1 this year,” Mr De Luca said.
“This means hundreds of thousands of Australians are now benefitting from the NDIS and its life changing support, right across the country’, Mr De Luca said.
Mr De Luca said that while figures show NDIS participant satisfaction has increased this quarter – up from 84 to 88 per cent, further improvement work is under way to ensure a quality and consistent experience for people with disabilities and providers.
“The results of the survey are very encouraging, however, there is still room for improvement and we continue to work on a number of initiatives to further enhance the experience.”
The report shows the NDIS continues to be delivered within budget as it has each year since it started in 2013. For more information, the
latest COAG NDIS Quarterly Report for 1 April 2018 – 30 June 2018 (external)
can be found on the NDIS website.

NDIS draws on local expertise in remote APY Lands
Listen

Save page as PDF
15 January 2014
The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is breaking new ground in support of children with disability living in remote areas.
National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) chief executive David Bowen said a report by the Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Women’s Council (NPYWC), released today, would assist Indigenous Australians in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) Lands.
APY Lands has a population of about 2500 and spans more than 103,000km from north-west South Australia into Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
"The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), which administers the NDIS, has been working with Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory and South Australia to identify and assist people with disability," Mr Bowen said.
"This report is part of that work and the Agency has already accepted many of its recommendations," he said.
"We want to make sure children in this area are able to benefit from the NDIS through our South Australian trial site while being respectful of their culture.
"Learning about the needs of local people with disability, cultural differences and traditions on child raising is vital in making the NDIS the best it can be in the APY Lands and other remote and isolated communities.
"The input from the Women’s Council has been invaluable."
The NDIA is already acting on several NPYWC recommendations including
funding for a local area coordinator based with the Women's Council
clear and simple participant plans which specify services and equipment rather than funding amounts, and
working with service providers to identify and enhance available supports for families
"Other suggestions will also be taken into account and the NDIA looks forward to working with the NPYWC and Indigenous communities across Australia to ensure the best outcomes for people with disability," Mr Bowen said.
"I encourage everyone to read the final report of the NPY Women's Council. It is a carefully-considered insight by people who live within some of our most remote communities," he said.
"The vision of the NDIS is to maximise independence and participation in their communities.
“The NDIS is still in the trial period and we are learning and building by ensuring people with disability are at the centre of the scheme."

NDIS offers Murray Bridge employment opportunities

22 September 2014
Up to 15 jobs are available in the new Murray Bridge office of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) in what will be a welcome economic boost to the area.
National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) South Australian trial site manager Meryl Zweck said the Murray Bridge office is expected to open early next year.
The new roles are in addition to the staff already working from the St Marys and Elizabeth offices.
“We are looking for people that are passionate about equality, their community and improving the lives of people with disability,” Ms Zweck said.
“The roles advertised cover a range of fields, including planning support, administration and finance,” she said.
“The Murray Bridge office will provide a local contact point for children and their families who have already joined the NDIS and those that apply to access it in future.”
Ms Zweck said the NDIS was progressing well in South Australia, with 1355 children having individualised disability support plans in place in the first year of the trial.
The trial site commenced operations on July 1 last year and is available for children aged 13 years and under.
“The staff at the new Murray Bridge office will play a key role in the NDIS trial and help inform how the scheme will rollout for children across Australia,” Ms Zweck said.
“Their work will make a real difference to the lives of children with disability and their families, particularly in the Murray Mallee, Mount Barker and the broader Adelaide Hills region,” she said.
“We need your local expertise and knowledge to make the NDIS the best it can be.”

National Disability Insurance Agency Statement – NDIA Expenditure
Listen
Print this page
Save page as PDF
2 October 2018
On 28 September 2018
The Australian
published an article which included information about the profile of the National Disability Insurance Agency's (NDIA) expenditure.
The NDIA is unable to reconcile the expense data provided in
The Australian
article. In the interest of transparency, the NDIA is providing the details of its operating costs to ensure the correct facts are on the record.
The information provided below is from the 2017-18 Agency's Financial Statements and a true reflection of expenses incurred.
The NDIA takes the prudent management of its finances extremely seriously. The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is, and remains, under budget, as it has done every financial year to date.
In 2017-18, the NDIA's operating expenses were $907 million against its budget of $1053 million, generating an operating surplus of $146 million.
Operational expenses for the NDIS have increased by 56.5 per cent in the last 12 months, compared with participant growth of 102 per cent (90,638 to 183,965).
The Australian
article notes that it is based on material from the NDIA which relates to the Senate Order on Entity Contracts, also known as the Murray Motion.
The Murray Motion requires Commonwealth entities to publish details of contracts with a value of $100,000 or more, twice a year during the relevant 12 month reporting period. The NDIA published the required information on 31 August 2018 in accordance with the Murray Motion requirements.
The Murray Motion schedule of contracts will not match the actual financial reporting of the NDIA for a number of reasons, including that it does not include contracts under $100,000 and it does not include contracts that ended during the reporting period that commenced before the reporting period started.
As appropriate, the largest expenses incurred by the NDIA (equating to 72 per cent) are related to Agency staff and Partners who support for participants, providers and delivery of the Scheme.
In 2017-18, 31.9 per cent of Agency operating costs or $288.8 million, relate to partnerships for delivery of the NDIS in local communities, including front line staff working as Local Area Coordinators and Early Childhood partners who directly support NDIS participants, their families and carers.
NDIS employee benefits represent 26.1 per cent of Agency operating costs or $235.3 million. The primary role of NDIA staff is to deliver services to participants and providers.
Contractor costs account for 14 per cent of operating costs or $127.1 million. Contactor staff are required during the transition period to provide additional workforce capability for a period of time. Contractors are an appropriate, flexible and responsible workforce choice during this period of significant growth and change.
The Agency spent 8.4 per cent of operational costs or $95.4m on shared services provided by Commonwealth Government partners for infrastructure and corporate support services. This includes arrangements with the Department of Human Services (DHS) to deliver essential enabling services, for example, ICT and payroll services.
Property, leases and associated expenses represent 6.2 per cent of operational cost or $56.0 million.
The Agency also requires specialist skillsets to deliver the NDIS. These include actuarial and public reporting services, research and consultation, specialist disability expertise, legal, communication and publication services and amounts 4.3 per cent of Agency operational costs or $39.1 million.
In addition to the Agency operational expenditure detailed above, the NDIA also provided grants of $71.8 million through Information Linkages, and Capacity Building. These grants provide funding to Australian businesses, community groups, researchers and charities to make sure people with disability are better connected and supported in their communities.
The Agency's operating costs are appropriately separated and do not impact on the funds allocated and expended supporting NDIS participant's plans.
More than 200,000 Australians are already benefitting from the NDIS as it rolls out across the country with 460,000 expected to benefit from the Scheme at full roll out. Of this number, 60,000 people are receiving disability supports for the first time. This has been achieved by a strong focus on delivering an improved experience for participants.

Quarterly Report: NDIS on track and on budget
Listen

Save page as PDF
18 August 2014
People with disability are accessing the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) in record time and costs remain on track, according to the scheme’s latest quarterly data.
The “Report on the sustainability of the scheme”, released today, shows the average cost of individualised NDIS support packages in the first year of the scheme was $34,600* within the funding expectation of $35,000.
National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) chairman Bruce Bonyhady said while early data needed to be approached with caution, a picture was starting to emerge.
“What we are seeing is a scheme built on evidence continually identifying and implementing better ways of doing things, and adjusting to its surroundings,” Mr Bonyhady said.
“The time it takes for an access decision to be made is testament to this,” he said.
“The average time taken to determine eligibility from launch in July last year to the end of December was 29.7 days. In the last six months to June 30 this has more than halved to 13.3 days.
“This significant improvement is the result of a number of operational reforms within the Agency, and reflects its effective learn-build-learn-build approach.
“The NDIS is all about the people it supports, and the Agency will continue working to streamline its processes to benefit them and their families.”
Key findings of the report on the four trial sites in the Hunter (NSW), Barwon (VIC), South Australia and Tasmania include:
Participant satisfaction remains very high at 1.66 on a scale of -2 (very poor) to +2 (very good).
8585 people have been found eligible for the NDIS, with 7316 having approved individualised support plans in place by the end of June.
The average package cost in the first year of the scheme is $34,600, down from $40,500 in the first six months, and below the funding expectation of $35,000.
More than $130 million is estimated to have been committed to NDIS participants in 2013-14.
Mr Bonyhady was pleased the data revealed consistently high participant satisfaction.
“However, we are committed to listening to, and learning from, people’s experiences with the scheme in order to continually improve it,” Mr Bonyhady said.
“Participant satisfaction to date is also reflected in the very few appeals lodged with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal just 19 to date,” he said.
“This level is unheard of for a human services organisation and, I believe, demonstrates that people with disability and their families are well-informed of the decision-making process.”
The NDIA is committed to continual improvement and current work includes:
Implementing a way of measuring outcomes for participants, their families and carers. This will provide feedback about particular groupings of scheme participants and the extent to which the Agency is meeting its objectives.
Developing strategies and models of support for Indigenous communities, culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities, rural and remote communities, and for mental health.
Establishing appropriate sector data collection to monitor the price and cost of supports delivered.
Mr Bonyhady said the data showed the experiences of the trial sites and feedback received was helping to build the NDIS.
“Operations are continuously improving and its budget is on track it is financially sustainable and governed by insurance principles,” he said.
“A groundbreaking new scheme like the NDIS the biggest social policy reform in 30 years is not perfected by simply willing it. It requires putting in the time and effort to get it right.
“I would like to thank the many, many people that have committed their time and effort – participants, their families, service providers, MPs and the broader community. Your input, ideas and feedback will ensure the NDIS is the best it can be and is available for current and future generations.”
* Average cost excluding Stockton, a large group home in the Hunter that is temporarily distorting the numbers.

NDIA statement in response to the OPA Report

2 October 2018
The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) takes all matters relating to participants experiences with the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) seriously. The NDIA is considering the Victorian Office of the Public Advocate's report in detail, and working to ensure the recommendations appropriately addressed, noting a number of these recommendations are being addressed through existing and ongoing work being undertaken by the Agency. The NDIA appreciates the important work the OPA does with and on behalf of participants, and welcomes evidence based insights and reviews. This feedback helps the NDIA deliver a better a service to participants.
The Agency continues to work closely with State and Territory Governments, peak bodies and sector representatives to ensure the NDIS meets the needs and expectations of participants, their families and carers and assists them to exercise choice and control over their lives.
The Agency recognises the significant challenges posed by rolling out a social reform the size and scale of the NDIS. The NDIA has been listening to participants and providers about what works and what doesn't work, and how to improve the NDIS experience. Since April 2017, through the participant pathway review, the Agency has been piloting and implementing improvements to the way the NDIS is delivered.
The NDIA will implement national improvements to the participant experience from October 2018, including:
A complex support needs pathway to assist participants with complex support needs and improve their access to services;
Clear links to other service systems to make sure that people get the supports they need from other services like the housing, education, employment and health systems;
Stronger connections between NDIA planners and Local Area Coordinators (LACs), who will become a consistent point of contact for the participant, and;
Ongoing work with Mental Health Australia to implement a psychosocial disability service stream to better address the needs of participants with psychosocial disability.
The NDIA is also working to enhance the provider pathway, including for those providers who support participants with more complex needs. The NDIA has initiated a pilot project to test the implementation of the complexity recommendations of the Independent Price Review, and provided further market information on Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) to support the market to respond to the demands of participants for fit-for-purpose housing solutions.
The NDIA has been working closely with the Commonwealth Departments of Social Services and Health and state and territory governments through the Senior Officials Working Group (SOWG) to clarify service systems responsibilities under the NDIS Act 2013, NDIS Rules 2013, and under the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). This work will improve the NDIS experience for participants who interact with multiple government service systems.
The Agency has contacted the OPA to work to address the concerns of the individual cases raised in the report.

18 July 2014 – KPMG paper released ahead of stakeholder consultation

Save page as PDF
18 July 2014
The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) is totally committed to delivering the full National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) as quickly as possible and sustainably, NDIA chairman Bruce Bonyhady said today.
Mr Bonyhady’s comments came as the NDIA released a paper, prepared by KPMG, which explores some of the issues around the NDIS transition to full scheme.
Mr Bonyhady said the paper was released as he and NDIA chief executive David Bowen prepare to embark on an extensive round of engagement with the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments and peak disability groups.
“What this KPMG paper does is identify some of the lessons from the trial sites to date together with some of the complexity surrounding rollout to full scheme. It is one of the many inputs, which will be considered as we start to talk to our stakeholders about the best way forward,” Mr Bonyhady said.
“One year into the NDIS trial phase, there’s a wealth of good solid data from the trial sites which will be of huge assistance as we build a strong and sustainable NDIS. All of this information means the Agency is in a strong position to have a mature, informed and consensus-building discussion about the optimal way to transition to the full NDIS and building the scheme to last.
“At my National Press Club address last week, I flagged many of the issues the Agency is working through as it learns and builds a world’s best practice scheme,” Mr Bonyhady said.
“As I said at the National Press Club, we have sought a range of expert advice and opinions on how the full scheme rollout should occur, including commissioning KPMG to provide a report into the risks and opportunities.
“This is just one of many inputs being considered in preparation for our discussions with States, Territories and peak bodies. Once we’ve had these discussions, in coming months we will be providing advice to Government on the transition to full scheme.
“We are committed to getting the NDIS right, both for those waiting on it now, and for future generations.
“Build the scheme up too fast and allow demand to out-strip supply, and we risk failure by driving up costs through inflation and lowering service quality. Build it up too slowly and we will also fail people with disability, their families and carers.”

Progress Report - NDIS Year One
Listen

Save page as PDF
9 July 2014
The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) today released its first annual Progress Report, updating the Australian community on the roll-out of the National Disability Insurance Scheme.
The Progress Report sets out what the NDIS has achieved so far in its Trial Phase, as well as areas where more work needs to be done to enable the NDIA to deliver the full scheme to more than 400,000 Australians with disability.
NDIA chairman Bruce Bonyhady said the first year of the rollout had seen the NDIA learning and building, listening to the advice of people with disabilities, who are at the heart of the scheme.
“Importantly, this Progress Report outlines what we have heard by listening carefully to all of our stakeholders, what we have learnt from our experiences so far, what we have learnt from our research and data and what we are doing as a result,” Mr Bonyhady said.
“We will publish a Progress Report each year to ensure we’re delivering on our strategic plan, benchmarking our progress and actively engaging Australians in our progress.”
The Progress Report discusses the scheme’s achievements, and areas for further work in relation to its three key strategic goals, specifically:
providing more control and choice to Australians with disability
ensuring the NDIS is financially sustainable and governed by insurance principles, and
building the Australian community ownership, confidence and pride in the NDIS.
The Progress Report also includes first-hand accounts from Australians who are participating in the NDIS Trial Phase.
Shahni Moore explained how the NDIS had given her the confidence and guidance to join the workforce for the first time after acquiring a brain injury at age 15 from a bicycle accident.
“The NDIS is giving me opportunities that I simply wouldn’t have been able to take advantage of,” Ms Moore said.
The Progress Report also sets out satisfaction levels among participants in the NDIS Trial Phase. Measured on a scale of +2 (extremely satisfied) to -2 (extremely dissatisfied), satisfaction with the NDIA so far is sitting at 1.66 – a satisfaction rating of more than 90 per cent.
Mr Bonyhady said that while Australians could be proud of what the NDIS has achieved in just one year of operation, there was still an enormous amount of hard work, listening, learning and building ahead as the NDIS is rolled out across the country.
“We hope this Progress Report helps you understand how far we’ve come and how far we’ve got to go, so you can share our energy and enthusiasm for this remarkable journey,” Mr Bonyhady said.
The Progress Report is being released to coincide with the one year anniversary of the launch of the NDIA Trial Phase. The report can be found on the

21 September 2018
Territorians with a disability, their carers and providers now have a single, central and accessible National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) office in Darwin.
The new office, located on Harry Chan Avenue, Darwin, was officially opened today by Chairman of the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), Dr Helen Nugent AO.
Joining Dr Nugent at the opening was fellow NDIA Board Member, Mr John Langoulant AO and representatives of the Northern Territory Government.
Minister for Families and Social Services, Paul Fletcher, said the new office will not only allow the NDIA to work closely with people with disability in the Northern Territory, it will also play a key role in delivering the NDIS to rural and remote communities spanning several states.

NDIS Fraud Taskforce update
Listen
Print this page
Save page as PDF
6 September 2018
The Australian Government established the NDIS Fraud Taskforce in July 2018 to tackle serious fraud against the NDIS.
The Taskforce is a partnership between the NDIA, the Department of Human Services (DHS) and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to identify targets of interest and conduct joint investigations to disrupt any suspected fraudulent activity.
The Taskforce has already identified a small number of providers who may be seeking to exploit the NDIS.
These providers are under investigation by the Taskforce.
As a result of these on-going investigations a number of providers have been blocked from accessing payments while suspicious claims are being investigated, to ensure participants are protected.
The NDIA has also commenced contacting a small number of impacted participants. The NDIA will ensure participants funds are reinstated, where appropriate.
The NDIA is continuously improving systems and controls as the NDIS, a major national reform, is implemented across Australia.
To this effect enhancements are regularly being made to the NDIS provider portal to facilitate its effectiveness and to further strengthen controls against unscrupulous behaviour.
Anyone who is aware that fraud is being committed against the NDIS should contact the police or the NDIS fraud hotline on 1800 650 717.
The NDIA and Commonwealth Government will not tolerate the misuse of funds intended to support people with disability and takes all reports of suspected fraud seriously.
Fraud is a crime. People who commit criminal acts run the risk of being subject to criminal prosecution.

NDIS opens at first NT trial site

29 June 2014
The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) commences in the Barkly on 1 July, giving local people with disability access to tailored support.
National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) chief executive David Bowen said the Barkly NDIS trial site will play a pivotal part in the national rollout of the scheme.
“The Barkly trial will inform how the NDIS will need to operate in all rural and remote areas,” Mr Bowen said.
“The about 140 anticipated Barkly participants are spread over 322,500 square kilometres – to put it in perspective, that’s more than 1.3 times the size of the United Kingdom,” he said.
“Service provision and infrastructure are significant challenges in every remote area.
“The NDIS will build on the existing disability services footprint and it is our hope the new scheme will allow resourcefulness and innovation within local communities.”
The scheme will fund the reasonable and necessary support needed for people to achieve their individual goals and aspirations.
NDIA general manager of operations Liz Cairns said individualised disability support plans are the key to changing lives.
“The scheme can help participants and their families to engage in education, employment and their community, become more independent and receive necessary equipment,” Ms Cairns said.
“The NDIS is the biggest social policy change in 30 years – it is important we get it right and that is why it is being trialled across Australia,” she said
“The Barkly community has been really supportive and we look forward to continuing this learning journey with them.”
From 1 July, NDIS trail sites also commence in the ACT and Perth Hills. These sites now join four existing sites in the Hunter (NSW), Barwon (VIC), South Australia (for children under six years of age), and Tasmania (for young people, aged 15 to 24 years).

NDIA releases efficient price to build competitive market for disability services
Listen

Save page as PDF
27 June 2014
The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) has today released a methodology to achieve an ‘efficient price’ for key disability supports which will help build a more competitive market and underpin real choice for Australians with disability.
An efficient price is a benchmark that providers of support should be able to operate within, when supporting people with disability. The benchmark efficient price will be effective from 1 July 2016.
An efficient price for weekday daytime is calculated to be $36.70 in today’s dollars, indexed at July 1 each year for inflation and adjusted on December 1 each year for the Equal Remuneration Order (ERO). Hourly rates for shift and weekends will also be increased consistent with the day time rates.
“An efficient price will enable people with disability to purchase high-quality services, while also ensuring an NDIS which is efficient, sustainable and good value for money for Australian taxpayers in a difficult fiscal environment,” NDIA chief executive David Bowen said.
It follows extensive consultation by a Joint Working Group including equal representation from the NDIA and National Disability Services (the peak body for not-for-profit providers), along with economic, pricing and accounting experts.
To help providers adjust to the price, and to ensure a strong supply of services into the future, the NDIA has today also released a ‘transitional price’, effective from 1 July 2014.
The transitional price will start at $38.78 for weekdays and will be stepped down in three instalments until it aligns with the efficient price on 1 July 2016.
The cost of the transitional price will be fully offset within the NDIS’ funding envelope and will not add to the cost to Australian taxpayers of delivering the NDIS.
The transitional price will apply in NDIS trial sites except in South Australia, where the current July 1 2014 rate of $41.19 is marginally higher, but will be brought into alignment with other states over the next two years.
The NDIA will also deliver a range of measures to help providers adjust to the efficient price and to help build a competitive market. For example, providers will be able to charge for late-notice cancellations in some circumstances, providing more cash-flow certainty.
The NDIA will also examine new technology platforms to make it easier for providers to interact with the NDIA, increasing efficiency and helping to level the playing field for smaller and regional and rural providers in particular.
The NDIA is committed to continuous learning and improvement, and so will expand its data collection activities as the NDIS grows to inform future pricing decisions.
More information about the efficient price and the transitional price is available on the
NDIS website

The NDIS one-year on - a note from our CEO
Listen

26 June 2014
Next week marks the first anniversary of the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It is timely that we take a moment to reflect just how far we have come in that year, and also to name some of the challenges we will face going forward to full scheme rollout in coming years.
The significance of the NDIS should not be underestimated. Australia has not seen a social policy change of this scope since the introduction of Medicare. We are turning around a system that was identified by the Productivity Commission only four years ago as ‘unfair, fragmented, underfunded and inefficient’.
It will transform the lives of people living with disabilities now and into the future, as well as providing their families assurance that their loved ones will be supported to fulfil their potential. We are building a scheme to make a real difference now and for the future.
The first year has very much been a year of learning and building, advised by the people who are at the heart of the NDIS – the participants. We have rolled out trial sites in Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania, and brought more than 6000 people into the scheme. This has been a massive undertaking, however this is a modest kick-off to what will be exponential growth of the scheme in coming years. In six years, we will have brought some 40,000 Australians into the scheme, and tripled the size of the service provider sector.
On July 1, we are opening three more trial sites in the Australian Capital Territory, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. These sites will provide further lessons for the scheme as we continue to build to full rollout, and see more than 10,000 more participants take advantage of the choice and control of individualised care plans.
With these plans progressing well, the National Disability Insurance Agency is turning its attention to another important, and possibly less understood part of its role – developing and facilitating the service provider sector to develop a robust, responsive and efficient marketplace. This is a massive undertaking, working in partnership with service providers to build capacity to thrive in a rapidly expanding marketplace. This includes moving to price efficiency which protects participants, allows a robust service sector, and gives society assurance that the system is sustainable and value-for-money.
Listening to service providers, participants and a range of medical and economic experts, we are learning every step of the way through the rollout. We have much to do, and in coming weeks we will get the fourth quarter data on the rollout. This data, when combined with the independent expert advice and the qualitative feedback from participants and trial site staff, will give us yet more visibility about the scheme’s successes and opportunities for improvement, for while the early research is showing a very high rate of satisfaction among participants, there is always more to do to ensure we are building the best scheme we possibly can for all Australians. We cannot afford anything less.

Board announces new CEO of NDIA

19 July 2017
The Board of the National Disability Insurance Agency is pleased to announce that Mr Rob De Luca has been appointed as Chief Executive Officer of the NDIA. Mr De Luca will commence his three year appointment on 28 August 2017.
He will succeed Mr David Bowen who in March announced his intention to retire after 5 years as the NDIA's inaugural CEO.
Mr De Luca has had a distinguished career, most recently as the Managing Director of Bankwest from 2012 to 2017. He has also been the Executive General Manager, Corporate Financial Services at Commonwealth Bank of Australia; and Chief Executive Officer of ASB Group Investment in New Zealand.
Mr De Luca has demonstrated his ability to lead large, high performing organisations; significantly and tangibly improved customer satisfaction; motivated staff using a values-led leadership approach; and utilised technology to improve the customer experience.
Welcoming Mr De Luca’s appointment, the Chairman of the NDIA, Dr Helen Nugent AO, said “the capabilities that Rob brings to the role of CEO at the NDIA are critical at this stage of the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The Board has appointed a values-driven leader who deeply understands the importance of improving social and economic outcomes for participants in a way that delivers a quality participant experience. He has the skills to deliver on that objective; to inspire staff and partners; and to improve the processes and technology on which participants and providers rely. In addition, he has the experience to manage the risks in the rollout of the Scheme and to work to ensure that the Scheme remains financially sustainable and operates within the defined funding envelope. Most importantly, he is passionate about making a difference to the lives of people with disability.”
These views were reinforced by Mr David Bowen, the outgoing CEO. He said that “It has been an immense privilege to lead this Scheme from Trial through to a year of Transition. I am delighted that the Board has appointed a CEO of Mr De Luca’s undoubted ability to lead the next stage of the Scheme. I look forward to working with him as part of an orderly handover”.
Mr De Luca said “I am committed to making a difference to the lives of Australians with a significant and permanent disability.
Making the transition to full Scheme over the coming years will be challenging, but with the goodwill of participants, their families and carers as well as providers and the disability sector more broadly, the NDIA will deliver on the Scheme’s promise to improve the lives of people with disability in Australia. I look forward to working with the staff of the NDIA and with the sector more broadly to achieve this goal.”

Quarterly Report shows participation in NDIS doubles, costs on track

1 May 2014
Participation in the National Disability Insurance Scheme has doubled since last December while costs remain well on track according to the NDIS third Quarterly Monitoring Report, released today.
The report – which covers the three months to March 31 – also shows that average package costs have fallen in the quarter, following improvements in January which provided more guidance about reasonable and necessary levels of support.
National Disability Insurance Agency Chairman Bruce Bonyhady said levels of satisfaction among participants in the NDIS remains very high according to survey data in the report.
“The NDIS is on budget and is growing steadily. That’s welcome news given how crucial the NDIS is to our community and our economy,” Mr Bonyhady said.
“This report shows we are using the experiences gained in the trial sites to build a better NDIS, with better outcomes for Australians with disability and their families.”
To date the largest disability groups across the trial sites are autism, intellectual disability, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy.
Key findings in the report from the four trial sites in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania include:
6,434 participants have been found eligible for the NDIS, with 5,414 having an approved plan by the end of March. This is double the number at the end of December.
The average package cost is now $34,000, down from $40,500 at the end of December, and below the funding expectation of $35,000.
Around $107 million of support will flow to participants in 2013/14. This is well within the funding envelope of $152 million for 2013/14.
Satisfaction among participants is very high, sitting at 1.66 on a scale of -2 (extremely unsatisfied) to +2 (extremely satisfied).
“There will obviously be quite a bit of variability in the data from quarter to quarter as different groups are phased into the NDIS. But these results show it’s steady as she goes in the NDIS trial sites, although of course we’ve still got lots more work to do,” Mr Bonyhady said.
In the months ahead the NDIS will undergo further improvements to improve the experience and flexibility of participants, as well as the value for money for all Australian taxpayers. The NDIA is working to:
Build a diverse and innovative market for disability support, including fostering new providers and helping existing providers move from block funding to a contestable market.
Make individual plans more flexible and provide greater control and choice to participants.
Increase the capacity of disability support organisations to get people ready for the broader roll-out of the NDIS.
Ensure approved plans help to build family, informal and community supports.
Work with governments to tackle challenges with “in-kind” arrangements which restrict control and choice among participants and hurt cash-flow for some providers.
This NDIA is committed to delivering the best scheme possible to build better lives for Australians with disability and their families, and a stronger economy and national budget.
The Productivity Commission – in its most exhaustive study ever – found that the NDIA will add around one per cent to gross domestic product when fully operational.
Prior to the NDIS, spending on disability by all government was growing at eight per cent per year, after inflation. Accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers estimate that by 2035 the cost of disability services without reform will be $20 billion more than the annual cost of the NDIS.
The NDIA extends its thanks to everyone involved in the trial phase of the NDIS so far, and looks forward to constantly improving the NDIS.

Former Mental Health Commissioner to advise NDIA
Listen

Save page as PDF
3 April 2014
Prominent mental health and disability expert Eddie Bartnik has been engaged as a strategic adviser to the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA).
NDIA chairman Bruce Bonyhady said Mr Bartnik has just completed his term as Western Australia’s first Mental Health Commissioner. He will play a key part in ensuring the Agency’s approach to mental health is robust and appropriate and will bring his vast experience in disability, especially local area coordination and community capacity building, to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).
“We are thrilled to welcome Mr Bartnik he has a long list of achievements in mental health and human services reform, most recently as inaugural WA Mental Health Commissioner,” Mr Bonyhady said.
“As Commissioner, he successfully established the Mental Health Commission as a new state government agency, overseeing 80 service provision contracts with public, private and community organisations supporting more than 48,000 people with mental illness,” he said.
“Mental illness and psychosocial disability are complex subjects in their own right and present significant challenges in relation to the NDIS.
“For example, the concept of permanent impairment that is central to the framing of the NDIS does not sit easily within the framework and language of recovery which are the basis of current best practice in mental health.
“Mr Bartnik’s experience and leadership will be pivotal in navigating these challenges and informing the Agency’s approach to these very important issues.”
Mr Bartnik will commence his new role on 28 April 2014 through a three-year consultancy contract.
He previously contributed to debate around the NDIS and looks forward to being directly involved in the Scheme.
“The NDIS is a much-needed reform that enables people with disability and their families to plan and build a good life in the community and have choice and control over the implementation of their reasonable and necessary supports,” Mr Bartnik said.
“I am excited to be a part of this landmark reform and its role in improving the lives of people with disability and their families,” he said.
Eddie Bartnik biography
Eddie Bartnik has just completed his three-and-a-half year term as Western Australia’s first Mental Health Commissioner, the first position of its kind in Australia. He led mental health reform and oversaw the Commissioning of public, private and community sector mental health services to over 48,000 people with a budget in excess of $650 million.
He joined the mental health sector from his previous position as Acting Director General of the Department for Communities in WA, following a long career as a Director with the Disability Services Commission where he had a lead role in the establishment and implementation of the state-wide Local Area Coordination program in Western Australia and then nationally and internationally.
Eddie has worked extensively and published across Australia and overseas in areas of human services reform and individualised funding/personalised support, with 25 years’ direct experience of this approach. He also has extensive experience at a state and national level in disability and mental health policy development, services planning and implementation.
He is Fellow of the Australian Institute of Management, a Fellow of the Australasian Society for Intellectual Disability and a graduate of the Australian Institute of Company Directors. He holds master’s degrees in clinical psychology from the University of WA and educational studies from the University of Tasmania. In 2013-14 he received awards from both Mental Health Carers WA and The Foundation for Social Inclusion.
Eddie led development and implementation of the strategic policy “Mental Health 2020: Making it Personal and Everybody’s Business” and presented the Australian keynote address at the International Initiative for Mental Health Leadership conference in New Zealand in 2013. He also supports Local Area Coordination projects and disability reform in New Zealand and the UK. He has unique experience of long-term systems reform across a range of contexts.

NDIS welcomes agreement with Western Australia

1 April 2014
The Chairman of the Board of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, Bruce Bonyhady, has warmly welcomed the signing of the agreement between the Australian Government and the Government of Western Australia which prepares the way for the NDIS trial site to launch in the Perth Hills on 1 July.
Mr Bonyhady said planning and preparations by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) for the WA trial site are well underway following the appointment of Marita Walker as WA Manager earlier this year.
Officials of both the NDIA and the West Australian Disability Services Commission have been working closely together to put in place new operational arrangements for the NDIS trial site.
Work is continuing to fit out a building for the NDIA headquarters in Midland.
“The signing of today’s agreement between Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Premier Colin Barnett is an important milestone for the NDIS in WA,” Mr Bonyhady said.
“It’s expected that up to 4,000 people in the Perth Hills will benefit from the NDIS, which will provide reasonable and necessary support to people with permanent and significant disability.”
“The NDIS is a nation-building reform with important social and economic benefits for Australia. The Productivity Commission report that recommended the Scheme be established estimated that the NDIS will ultimately add one percentage point to Australia’s GDP.
“I welcome the Prime Minister's continued support for the NDIS, and his leadership and commitment to this great social and economic policy reform delivered for all Australians with disability.”

Organisations receive funding to make ACT more inclusive

21 April 2017
Twenty-two grants totalling close to $3 million have been awarded to organisations by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) to make the ACT more accessible and inclusive of people with disability.
An inclusion support program to enable young families with disabilities to access local playgroups, a peer support network for people with mild cognitive disabilities at risk of homelessness or entering the criminal justice system and a series of interactive, disability-led capacity building workshops for community organisations are some of the projects that have received funding.
The projects have been funded as part of a new grant round to support the Information, Linkages and Capacity Building (ILC) component of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).
NDIA General Manager Community Linkages and Engagement, Maryanne Diamond, said these newly funded projects were an important and exciting step in developing ILC and realising our goals about inclusion.
“The two big goals that have been set for ILC are that people with disability have the ability to achieve their goals and are included in all aspects of community life. These projects are a great example of how we’re going about accomplishing that,” Ms Diamond said.
“It’s fantastic to see such breadth of ideas and collaboration to increase the independence, social and community participation for all people with disability, including those who do not have an NDIS plan.”
Of the 22 successful applicants, 16 organisations were from the ACT. Many of the recipients who were not from the ACT have partnered with ACT-based organisations.
Grants for more than $10,000 were provided to 18 applicants, with an additional four applicants receiving grants for less than $10,000. All grants are for one year initially, with the potential for extension of up to two more years.
The next ILC funding round in the ACT will open in the second half of 2017, with eligible organisations encouraged to apply. More information will be available on the
NDIS website

NDIA Chairman calls for accurate, up to date evidence-base in reporting economic benefits of NDIS
Listen

Save page as PDF
31 March 2014
On Saturday 29 March articles about the NDIS and its economic effects appeared in the Australian newspaper. The articles used early figures from the NDIS first quarterly report (now six months old) as the evidence base to comment on current Scheme costs and operations and to incorrectly extrapolate those early numbers to make claims that do not stand up to examination about the cost-benefit analysis of the NDIS at full scheme when it supports up to 460,000 individuals. In response to the factual inaccuracies in the articles the Chairman of the NDIA Board took the unusual step of writing to the newspaper to ask that more rigorous reporting of NDIS facts be used as the basis for the analysis of the NDIS now and into the future. The Chair’s letter is reproduced below.
Letter to the Editor of The Australian Newspaper
The key numbers used in Dennis Shanahan’s and Sid Maher’s articles on Saturday 29 March about the NDIS are out of date, muddled and do not provide the basis for any meaningful analysis of the Scheme’s future performance.
Neither journalist contacted the Agency to check their facts or figures.
The facts are that the first entrants to the Scheme, in the September quarter last year, were not selected to match the eligible population and so could never be extrapolated to estimate full Scheme costs, a point I made at the time and which was reported in your paper.
Since then average package costs have trended down and, even more importantly, total costs, which are the product of average costs and the numbers entering the Scheme, are tracking in line with the projected full Scheme costs.
As you would expect, the Board is monitoring all the facts, figures and roll out very carefully. There is still an enormous task ahead, but there is no cost blowout.
In the future, there will be much to be analysed and discussed about the NDIS and the positive contribution it will make to all Australians, not just those with disabilities. As that conversation develops, I hope that everyone will join it on the basis of evidence which is accurate, up to date and verifiable.

5 February 2014
The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) will host its first Northern Territory community forums this month as part of preparations for the scheme’s launch in the Barkly region from 1 July.
The forums will be held at the Tennant Creek Civic Centre on Wednesday, 19 February from 10am to midday for the general public and from 2pm to 4pm for potential scheme participants and their families.
David Bowen, chief executive of the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), said people with disability, their families, carers, service providers and community leaders are encouraged to attend. The NDIA is responsible for delivering the NDIS.
“We want to draw on your local expertise and knowledge to ensure the NDIS in the Barkly is the best it can be,” Mr Bowen said.
“For the scheme to be successful in changing the lives of people with a disability and their families, it must be delivered in a culturally-sensitive way that responds to community needs,” he said.
“We look forward to meeting local people at our Tennant Creek forums the first official NDIS events in the Northern Territory.”
The Barkly is one of three new trial sites that will commence operation on 1 July this year.
Archie Baker moved from Darwin to Tennant Creek in October to oversee the Barkly NDIS trial site.
He has many years’ experience in the field, specialising in statutory social work, disability services and indigenous affairs policy delivery in South Australian and Top End Territory communities as a senior public servant.
“It’s really exciting to be meeting with community groups, getting to know all of the local characters, and working together to prepare for when the NDIS opens to participants on 1 July,” Mr Baker said.
“There’s a lot of buzz about the NDIS around town and people are very supportive, even though they aren’t necessarily aware of the finer details of the scheme,” he said.
“These forums will give people a better understanding of how the NDIS will help people with disability access the reasonable and necessary supports they need and they can put forward all of their questions and ideas.”

Western Australia Trial Site Manager appointed for the NDIS
Listen

Save page as PDF
29 January 2014
The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) has appointed Ms Marita Walker as Manager of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) trial site in Western Australia, which will begin to operate in the Perth Hills area from 1 July 2014.
Ms Walker has been Chief Executive Officer of Perth Home Care Services (PHCS) for 15 years. PHCS is a leading service provider in Western Australia’s disability, aged care and mental health sectors to enable people to live at home with dignity connected to their family and community.
Ms Walker has extensive experience over many years in providing disability support services in senior roles in government and non-government organisations in Western Australia. She has been a strong supporter of the NDIS since the Productivity Commission recommended the establishment of the Scheme in 2011.
NDIA Chairman Mr Bruce Bonyhady warmly welcomed Ms Walker’s appointment to lead the operations of the NDIA in its critically important Western Australia trial site.
“Marita Walker brings unparalleled experience in the Western Australia disability sector and with individualised services to her new role with the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We are fortunate to have such a capable, experienced and highly regarded Western Australian leader join the NDIA to lead and develop our operations in the Perth Hills.”
“This is good news for people with disability and their families in our trial site, for disability support providers and for the community in the Perth Hills more generally, given Marita’s outstanding track record and very strong commitment to community.”
The August 2013 Agreement between the Commonwealth and West Australian Governments will see the NDIS begin its two-year trial in areas of Western Australia from 1 July 2014. The NDIS trial site is part of a two-year trial alongside the My Way initiatives of the Western Australia Government in the Lower South West region of WA and the Cockburn/Kwinana area of Perth.
Work commences on the NDIA office for the Perth Hills trial site of the NDIS
Fit-out construction has commenced on the new NDIA office for the NDIS Perth Hills trial site. The office will be at 74-78 Railway Parade, Midland.
Centrally located close to public transport and the new Midland Hospital and health precinct, the NDIS will offer more choice and greater control over reasonable and necessary supports for people with disability in the Perth Hills trial site.
Work on the office began after a lease was signed with the building’s owner and approval received from the City of Swan and the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority.
The NDIS will provide long-term, individualised support that is reasonable and necessary to meet the needs of people with permanent and significant disability. This may include the development and funding of an individual plan that focuses on a person’s goals and aspirations and the support needed to achieve these.
David Bowen, Chief Executive Officer of the NDIA, said the individual plans were the key to changing people’s lives.
“The plans are developed around a person’s goals, aspirations and needs, and can enable participants and their families to engage in education, employment and their community, become more independent and receive necessary equipment,” he said.
Mr Bowen paid special thanks to the City of Swan for its support in getting the Midland office redevelopment underway.
“We are very excited about the new Midland office and its role in supporting the Perth Hills as the NDIS is rolled out across Australia,” he said.

NDIS Planner meets with PM in Tennant Creek

25 July 2018
Sitting down to dinner with Prime Minister Turnbull was one of the last things NDIS planner Rhonda Plummer thought she would be doing on a Sunday night.
Rhonda is a local Tennant Creek woman and has been a planner with the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) since 2016. She was one of few who dined with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull when he visited recently.
Rhonda was eager to let Prime Minister Turnbull know just how much she enjoys working for the NDIS.
"It allows me to do something for my people," Rhonda told the Prime Minister.
"The Prime Minister replied that he recognised the importance of local people being employed by the Agency to work with the community, which I really appreciated hearing."
Rhonda attended the dinner along with other community leaders including her husband Ron, who as a Traditional Owner, performed the welcome to country for the Prime Minister.
Accompanying Prime Minister Turnbull to Tennant Creek were the Minister for Social Services Dan Tehan, Minister for Indigenous Affairs Senator Nigel Scullion and Chief Minister of the Northern Territory Michael Gunner.
The Agency's Northern Territory Regional Manager Lizzie Gilliam also briefed the Prime Minister and Minister Tehan on the NDIS in the Territory.
"Minister Tehan was especially interested to learn how participants in remote communities are pooling funds," Lizzie said.
"Pooling funds gives participants' greater purchasing power, enabling them to bring allied health services into their community.
"It is a very culturally appropriate way to use funding and is something we are encouraging, if participants are choosing it," Lizzie said.

The NDIS provides funding to eligible people with disability to gain more time with family and friends, greater independence, access to new skills, jobs, or volunteering in their community, and an improved quality of life.
The NDIS also connects anyone with disability to services in their community.
This includes connections to doctors, community groups, sporting clubs, support groups, libraries and schools, as well as providing information about what support is provided by each state and territory government.
The NDIS now supports over 500,000 Australians with disability to access the services and supports they need.
This includes supporting approximately 80,000 children with developmental delay, ensuring they receive supports early so that they achieve the best outcomes throughout their lives.
For more information you can view the
Participant Service Charter

booklets and factsheets page

20 July 2018
Participants may be contacted to participate in a NDIA survey between July and September 2018.
The NDIA will use survey results to help identify the types of supports that lead to good outcomes for participants and to improve the NDIS.
This survey will be conducted by Australian Healthcare Associates (AHA) on behalf of the NDIA and will take about 30 minutes to complete.
Participants selected to take part in the survey will receive a phone call, SMS or email from the NDIA, their Local Area Coordinator or the AHA before being asked to take part in the survey.
Parents will usually be asked to complete the survey on behalf of their child.
AHA may also ask to talk to a family member, if possible, and may ask them to complete a separate survey.
The NDIA is committed to listening to participants, their families and carers to constantly improve the NDIS.
If you have any doubt about the identity of the caller or their purpose, ask for their name and number and verify this by contacting the NDIA directly on 1800 800 110.
For more information contact the NDIA Call Centre on 1800 800 110.

NDIS supporting local jobs and better outcomes for people with disability in Tennant Creek

9 October 2015
People with disability, their families, carers and the wider community are benefitting from more supported accommodation in the Barkly region as a result of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) trial.
National Disability Insurance Agency Deputy CEO Louise Glanville said an additional three houses had recently opened in Tennant Creek as supported accommodation.
“This increase in supported accommodation is not only creating more options for people with disability, it is also providing local job opportunities,” Ms Glanville said.
“In recent months 17 local people have been trained as disability support workers by service providers who have started operating in the region as a result of the NDIS.
“Prior to the NDIS, Tennant Creek had limited supported accommodation for people with disability.
“Now a number of new disability service providers have registered to provide supported accommodation to NDIS participants.
“Jobs for local support workers are being created alongside this increase in accommodation, meaning the wider community is benefitting from the NDIS.”
Ms Glanville has been visiting Alice Springs to talk with disability service providers at a national conference.
“The NDIS trial in the Barkly region is helping us learn how best to make the NDIS work for people living in remote areas and work in the most effective way with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities,” Ms Glanville said.
“The NDIA is working closely with Aboriginal people, service providers and community groups as part of the trial in the Barkly region.
“Our latest report shows that as of June 30, more than 60 people with disability in the Barkly region have an individual plan in place with the NDIS and the number continues to grow.
“Across Australia, more than 17,000 people with disability now have individualised plans, giving them more choice and control over their lives and the supports they receive.”

NDIS in the media - Opinion piece from Vicki Rundle

30 May 2018
This opinion piece first appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and the Canberra Times on Wednesday 30 May.
Canberra resident Phillip Dodd's mobility was severely impacted following a motorcycle accident in the 1970s that resulted in a serious leg injury and an above-the-knee amputation in 2015.
When Phillip, who works full-time, became a participant in the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), he received a new prosthetic leg and modifications to his home and car to increase his independence. He is one of thousands in the ACT who had never received any type of disability services or support before the NDIS.
As Deputy CEO of the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), I regularly meet participants like Phillip, people whose lives are being transformed by the NDIS.
The ACT is the first state or territory in Australia in which the NDIS has been fully rolled out. This means that while ACT residents were among the first to benefit from the NDIS, some participants have also experienced the inevitable challenges that will arise from such a large and complex reform.
While much has been achieved during the trial and transition periods in ACT, we know there is much more to do.
The most significant achievement is the number of people in the ACT who are now benefitting from the Scheme. As at 31 March 2018, 6,613 people had an NDIS plan in place. Of those, 52% (or 3,468) were not previously receiving support from either the ACT or Commonwealth Governments. To emphasise the point, these people, like Phillip, needed help, but previously were not receiving it.
As a result of the NDIS, participants and their families in the ACT are telling us that the NDIS is helping them in many ways. Ninety-four per cent of parents of pre-school aged children are saying that the NDIS has improved their child's development and 74 per cent of people over 25 are telling us that the NDIS has helped them exercise greater choice. Australia-wide, 84 per cent of surveyed participants were satisfied with their NDIS experience.
However, as highlighted by the current ACT Parliamentary Inquiry into the implementation of the NDIS in the ACT, the roll out of the NDIS remains a work in progress and some participants' experiences have fallen short of our standards. It is clear that at the forefront of these challenges is the need to improve the planning process, which is why a new general participant pathway has been designed and is in the final stages of being tested.
In addition, the NDIA has already taken significant steps to address many of the issues which have been raised as part of the Inquiry.
For example, the rate of unscheduled reviews in the ACT during transition is high and has been the subject of significant work by the NDIA.
As ACT was amongst the early trial sites and the NDIS was brand-new, some mistakes were made in planning. We have worked closely with participants to address the issue and where broader issues were identified, introduced new processes or means to solve them.
In particular, many unscheduled reviews have occurred where assistive technology is part of a plan. We have implemented new assistive technology changes, which will help the 45 per cent of participants likely to require low cost assistive technology items to access funding and equipment in a timely manner.
It's also important to address some misconceptions around the underpinning principles of the NDIS, especially around people exiting the Scheme and variations in funding for participants' plans.
The NDIS is an insurance based Scheme. It is not welfare. It is underpinned by the fundamental proposition that by taking a life-time approach and investing in people early, the opportunity for individuals to live an ordinary life is maximised. This is particularly the case with children with developmental delay. A significant upfront investment will provide a lifetime of benefits.
There have been similar misconceptions around plan variations with reports that participant plans are being systematically reduced. In contrast, a large percentage of plans in ACT in the last year were increased by more than 10% on review. Moreover, in an insurance based Scheme, as opposed to a welfare system, there should be no expectation that plans should not be reduced. In some cases, reductions reflect a one-off investment in assistive technology; while in other cases, it results from the achievement of a goal that no longer needs funding.
It is possible there will be more challenges ahead as we continue to implement one of Australia's largest ever social reforms. But the opportunities and the benefits of the NDIS outweigh the challenges many times over. At last, people with disability have choice and control over their lives and can receive the reasonable and necessary supports they need.
As Phillip puts it: "The NDIS has really changed our lives. The thing I like most about the NDIS is that I was able to ask for the supports that I needed to live my life. I made the choice. I had a voice and was listened to.
"I saw that the NDIA is evolving and changing to become more client-friendly and that showed me that it was worth it."
My colleagues and I are absolutely committed to building a world-leading NDIS that empowers people with disability to achieve their goals in inclusive communities and workplaces.

NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits
NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits (previously the NDIS Price Guide) assist participants and disability support providers in understanding how price controls for supports and services work in the NDIS.
Price regulation is in place to ensure that participants receive value for money in the supports that they receive.
The Support Catalogue lists all available supports providers can use when lodging a payment request.
It also provides information on the current (and previous) price limits for each support item and indicates which claim types (travel, non-face-to-face, etc.) apply for each price-limited support item.
Price limits are the maximum prices that registered providers can charge NDIS participants for specific supports.
Participants and providers can negotiate lower prices. The rules outlined in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits must be followed when supports are delivered to NDIA-managed or plan-managed participants.
The NDIA regularly

How pricing decisions are made
Each year, The NDIA uses a mix of market data, research, and public and industry engagement to inform changes to pricing arrangements   and price limits through its Annual Pricing Review. While the Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits are updated throughout the year as necessary, the Annual Pricing Review plays a major role in significant updates to the document – effective 1 July each year.
To read more about the Annual Pricing Review, please visit the
Annual pricing review
webpage.
The NDIA regularly reviews and makes changes to pricing arrangements to ensure our approach:
better meets the needs of participants, their families, carers and providers
remains affordable and in place for future generations of Australians.
This is done by appointing expert committees, financial benchmarking, and forming dedicated working groups.
Find more information on how this is done, please visit our
Making pricing decisions webpage.

NDIS roles and responsibilities
The NDIS is Australia’s way of providing support to people with disability and supporters.
It allows eligible Australians with disability to choose providers from which to purchase the supports that enable them to pursue their goals.
The NDIA recognises the importance of a diverse, sustainable and well-developed NDIS market, which promotes innovation, quality, continuous improvement and best practice to enable people with disability to exercise choice and control in obtaining disability supports.
NDIS Market Roles and Responsibilities
outlines the vision for Australians with disability to be able to access support from innovative providers and skilled workers.
This will support people with disability to pursue their goals around independence, community involvement, education, employment, and health and wellbeing.
For the NDIS market to be successful, Disability Reform Ministers, Department of Social Services, the NDIA, the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, state and territory governments need to work together to deliver our shared vision.
Market approach
In December 2019, the former Disability Reform Council, agreed to use more flexible approaches to address NDIS market gaps. In October 2022, the now Disability Reform Ministerial Council reaffirmed this commitment.
The flexible approach recognises that a one-size-fits-all approach to NDIS access and service delivery in thin markets is not suitable to address market gaps faced by First Nations and culturally diverse communities in regional and remote Australia and across particular support types.
The
NDIA Corporate Plan 2023-2027
confirms the NDIA’s commitment to support participants to be more independent and engage socially and economically, while delivering a financially sustainable NDIS that builds genuinely connected and engaged communities and stakeholders.
The NDIA works with a variety of market stakeholders to build a stable and sustainable NDIS marketplace that facilitates development of innovative supports. This is to ensure participants have access to quality supports and services regardless of where they live and what their needs are.
The NDIA has trialled a range of approaches and continues to implement market coordination activities to address market gaps across Australia. Ways in which the NDIA help participants to get services they need include:
improving plan implementation
improving information signals
market facilitation
coordinated funding proposals
direct commissioning.
Market Facilitation
Market facilitation involves specific actions to improve connections between providers and participants, such as focused engagement and sharing targeted information with the market.
Coordinated Funding Proposals
A Coordinated Funding Proposal (CFP) is a process used to help a group of participants combine their funding to buy supports from NDIS providers. CFP’s can be run by participant/community groups without the assistance of the NDIA.
CFPs can help:
NDIS participants to combine their funding to increase their buying power
attract providers to communities where there are no available NDIS supports
support participants who have difficulty finding services
organise activities for a group of participants.
Find out more about Coordinated Funding Proposals.
Direct Commissioning
Direct commissioning is a way for the NDIA to arrange for services to be available for participants.
Direct commissioning is used where other levers are not sufficient to achieve sustainable improvements in markets.
Direct commissioning involves a formal contract between the NDIA and a provider or panel of providers, for longer term service delivery to a group of participants.
This lever requires the NDIA to specify, procure and manage the service arrangements with providers over the life of the contract.
Market monitoring
The NDIA monitors the market by analysing available data and talking with stakeholders to better understand the issues, where they are, their likely causes and their impact on participants. The NDIA then uses this information to decide which market levers to use and where to target market coordination efforts. The NDIA continues to refine and improve upon its approach to monitoring the NDIS marketplace as our knowledge and evidence base grows.
Quarterly reports and Data and Insights
The quarterly reports
provide information and data about participants and the funding or provision of supports by the NDIA in each area.
Data and insights
provides public data releases to ensure participants and their families and carers, researchers, advocates, policy makers and the general public can find out about Scheme operations.
Historic market monitoring
The NDIA previously produced
market dashboard reports
which compared a number of market indicators including plan utilisation, market concentration, participants per provider and provider growth and shrinkage across geographical regions and participant characteristics. The historic reports are located on the Market monitoring webpage and were produced to assist stakeholders to understand market trends.

The ways we engage
DRCO Forum
Key national stakeholders
Provider opportunities
Local communities
Co-design advisory group
Participants are at the heart of everything we do.
We engage with participants, their families and carers, along with the disability sector, advocacy groups, providers and other stakeholders, in many ways, every day.
Read two engagement case studies (DOCX 21KB)
.
As part of our commitment to strengthening our engagement with the disability community, we have developed the NDIA Engagement Framework.
This framework has been developed with disability sector representatives to guide, support and strengthen our engagement with the disability community now and into the future.
Find out more about the NDIS Engagement Framework
The disability community has strongly encouraged us to take a ‘learn by doing’ approach when co-designing important NDIS projects or initiatives.
This means we will continually review our approaches and this framework to make sure we engage in meaningful ways that deliver improved outcomes for people with disability.
NDIA Engagement Framework (DOCX 4.7MB)

We also apply
the Australian Public Service Framework for Engagement and Participation.
The ways we engage
The NDIA engages with participants, families, carers, the disability sector and other stakeholders through a wide range of activities.
These activities are accessible. So, whether it’s a meeting in person or online, getting information in a variety of formats, or providing written, audio or video feedback, everyone can join in.
Independent Advisory Council
The Council represents the voice of participants at the highest level. It gives independent advice to the NDIA Board on the most important issues affecting participants, carers and families.

(External website)
Reference groups
The NDIA has several sector reference and advisory groups.
Read our reference group updates
Participant First
The Participant First Engagement Initiative, which includes the Participant Engagement Panel, provides opportunities for participants, family members, carers and people with disability to get involved in improvement projects.
Find out more and get involved
Research and evaluation
Participants help design and evaluate our research and quality improvement projects. We also engage with the disability sector, government, research bodies and other stakeholders.
Research and evaluation information
Co-design advisory group
The Co-design Advisory Group provides strategic advice to the NDIA on the implementation of co-design and engagement processes in the disability community.
Find out more about the
co-design advisory group
.
Disability Representative and Carer Organisations Forum
The DRCO Forum
brings together CEOs and senior representatives from key disability sector organisations to engage, discuss, collaborate and co-design with us on important areas of work.
Forum members take part in workshops on specific topics of interest.
Key national stakeholders
We work closely with peak disability organisations and advocacy groups. An NDIA engagement manager is assigned to each group, to keep them informed and seek their expert input.
Provider opportunities
We support market growth and development to meet current and future demand.
We talk with providers and the disability sector about policies, plans and services to meet the needs of participants.
We also communicate with providers and measure their sentiment and satisfaction with the NDIS.
Local communities
Our engagement teams connect with people in local communities across Australia.
We share information about what’s happening in the Scheme and what’s changing – and most importantly, we listen.
We talk to people around the country, at NDIA information and consultation meetings, disability expos, in person and online.
The feedback we gather is reported back to inform Scheme improvement projects.
Welcome here project
We are committed to the inclusion of everyone who works at or engages with the Agency.
As proud members of the
Welcome here project
, we welcome and include LGBTIQA+ people.

The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA)
The NDIA makes decisions about whether someone is eligible to become an NDIS participant and, if so, how much funding they will receive. This is based on legislation called the
NDIS Act 2013
which sets out what supports and services are considered reasonable and necessary for the NDIS to fund.
Find out more about the NDIA
.
Early childhood partners
The early childhood approach helps children younger than 6 who have a developmental delay or children younger than 9 with disability. Early childhood partners deliver the early childhood approach.
Early childhood partners employ early childhood educators and allied health professionals who help children and their families access supports and services that are tailored to the child’s individual needs and circumstances.
Early childhood partners also help with connection to other appropriate supports such as community health services, playgroups and educational settings.
Find out more about the early childhood approach
.
Local area coordination (LAC) partners
Local area coordination partners are community-based organisations that we fund to help deliver local area coordination services in some parts of Australia. Local area coordination partners work with people with disability aged 9 to 64. For most people in this age range, a local area coordinator will be their main point of contact for the NDIS.
Local area coordination supports people with disability to create and work towards their goals, build capacity to make their own decisions and choices and access the supports they need to live the life they choose. Local area coordination also supports communities and multiple levels of government to create a more inclusive society and deliver improved outcomes for all people with disability.
Learn more about
Local area coordination partners
.
Remote Community Connectors
Remote Community Connectors, also known as NDIS Connectors, play a key role in helping to deliver the NDIS in remote and very remote communities.
This includes First Nations people with disability and those from a Culturally and Linguistically Diverse background.
NDIS Connectors work together to improve the lives of people with disability, their families and community.
They do this recognising diverse cultures and unique approaches needed to support these communities.
Learn more about how
NDIS Connectors
can support all people with disability to access the NDIS.

Our role is to implement the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), which will support a better life for hundreds of thousands of Australians with a significant and permanent disability and their families and carers.
The NDIA:
Provides information and referrals, links to services and activities, individualised plans and where necessary, funded supports to people over a lifetime.
Helps empower and inform people with disability to be confident consumers.
Provides service providers with clarity and transparency so they can grow their business and respond to need.
Raises community awareness and encourages greater inclusion and access for people with disability to mainstream services, community activities and other government initiatives.
The NDIS launched in July 2013, after years of discussion about the need for a major reform of disability services in Australia.

What is the role of a local area coordinator?
Linking you to information and support in your community
On this page:

2 - Linking you to information and support in your community
If you are aged 9 to 64, our partners may deliver local area coordination services in your area.
What is the role of a local area coordinator?
Local area coordinators support people with disability to create and work towards their goals, build capacity to make their own decisions and choices and access the supports they need to live the life they choose.
One of the ways local area coordination partners support NDIS participants and all people with a disability is by developing
community connections
.
Partners can help you understand and access the most appropriate
disability supports
available to you.
Local area coordinators can help you to:
Find practical information relevant to you – including information about disability, your rights and online supports and services.
Understand and access the NDIS – including workshops or talking to you about the NDIS.
Help with an NDIS plan – if you are eligible for supports through an NDIS plan, your local area coordinator will talk to you about your current situation, supports, and goals to help develop your plan. Local area coordinators cannot create or approve a plan, this is done by the NDIA.
Implement your NDIS plan – your local area coordinator can assist you to understand and use the supports in your NDIS plan to help you achieve your goals. The local area coordinator may be your NDIS contact person to discuss any questions you have about your plan.
Apply for a plan reassessment – your local area coordinator can check-in with you during your plan, to see how you are going and if the plan is working well for you. They can help you to apply for changes to your plan with a plan reassessment or plan variation.
Linking you to information and support in your community
Local area coordinators also support communities and multiple levels of government to create a more inclusive society and deliver improved outcomes for all people with disability.
You can ask your local area coordinator about the supports available in your community, even if you're not eligible for an NDIS plan. Local area coordinators have strong connections in community and can help you connect with supports in your local area including community groups, recreational activities such as sporting clubs, performing arts groups and other social networks.
Your local area coordinator can also help you understand how the
NDIS works with other government services
and can assist you to connect to supports like education, health and transport. This is part of the Information, Linkages and Capacity Building (ILC) Program
From mid-2020, the ILC Program transitioned from the NDIA to the Department of Social Services (DSS). For more information about the ILC Program, please visit the
DSS ILC webpage
.

There are around 4.3 million Australians who have a disability. Within the next five years, the NDIS will provide an estimated 500,000 Australians who have permanent and significant disability with funding for supports and services. For many people, it will be the first time they receive the disability support they need.
The NDIS can provide all people with disability with information and connections to services in their communities such as doctors, sporting clubs, support groups, libraries and schools, as well as information about what support is provided by each state and territory government.

What to provide with your child's Access Request
You can contact a local early childhood partner to support you with gathering evidence and applying to the NDIS
To allow the National Disability Insurance Agency to determine whether your child meets the early intervention or developmental delay requirements, you will need to provide evidence of your child's permanent disability or developmental delay to support their access request. This includes information on what your child's condition is, how long it will last and its impact on their life.
You can provide evidence of your child's disability or developmental delay by having their treating doctor or specialist complete the Professional's Report section in section 2 of the Access Request Form, the NDIS Supporting Evidence Form or you can provide the same information in a different format, such as copies of existing assessments and reports. The information must be provided with the Access Request Form.
If you choose not to use the the Professional's Report section in the Access Request Form or the NDIS Supporting Evidence Form it is important that you make sure the information you provide contains the same information that the form collects.
If you are not sure whether you have enough information to support your child's access request, or you have trouble getting the information, we may be able to help you.
Diagnosis
You must provide us with evidence of the diagnosis of your child's disability from your child's treating doctor or specialist.
Section 2 of the Access Request Form and the NDIS Supporting Evidence Form collects this information, or you can give us other written evidence of your child's diagnosis from their treating doctor or specialist. This needs to include information about any treatment/s your child is receiving.
Please note: for a child to meet the developmental delay requirements for the NDIS they must be aged under 6 years. Further information on the developmental delay is available in the
Operational Guideline – Access – Early Intervention Requirements
.
Evidence of the impact of your child's disability or developmental delay
If your child has a condition we have already identified as always resulting in permanent impairment and substantially reduced functional capacity, or as always benefiting from early intervention, then we do not require any further information. A list of these conditions can be found in the
Operational Guidelines List D
.
If your child's condition is not
on the list of 'Permanent impairment/functional capacity – no further assessment required' you must provide evidence of the impact of your child's condition on their life, including any impact on their mobility, communication, social interaction, learning, self-care and self-management.
You can provide this information by getting your child's specialist or an allied health professional to complete the Professional's Report section in Section 2 of the Access Request Form, the NDIS Supporting Evidence Form or you can provide us with other written evidence from their specialist or a health professional.
'A health professional' includes a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, speech pathologist, a psychologist or a nurse.
'Other written evidence' could include existing assessments or reports which were prepared by a specialist or allied health professional that provide the equivalent information on the impact of your child's condition on their life.
Submitting evidence
The evidence about your child's disability or developmental delay must be submitted with you access request when required by the NDIA. Their access request will not be considered complete unless we have received all the information we need. We will use the information about your child's disability or developmental delay to help us determine whether your child can become a participant in the NDIS.

increase your independence
be more involved in your community
participate in social, work and study life.
We can help you connect with other
health and community supports

Eligible people can
apply for NDIS funded supports
.
Support for people with mental health conditions and psychosocial disability
Where to go if you require immediate mental health support outside the NDIS
If you or someone you know need support, the services listed on the
Family violence and mental health support page
may be able to help.
For emergencies call triple zero (000).
Making community connections
If you need support for your psychosocial disability or mental health condition, first consider talking to a
local area coordinator
about community connections.
Community connections
can include things like help to access information, talking about how to access mainstream and community supports, or help to apply to the NDIS.

What types of supports are funded?
There are some kinds of supports that will not be funded or provided by the NDIS
What choice and control do I have over my funded supports?

On this page:
1 - What types of supports are funded?
2 - There are some kinds of supports that will not be funded or provided by the NDIS
3 - What choice and control do I have over my funded supports?
4 - Other community and government services
The NDIS provides funding to eligible people based on their individual needs.
Every NDIS participant has an individual plan that lists their goals and the funding they have received. NDIS participants use their funding to purchase supports and services that will help them pursue their goals.
Everyone has different goals but they could include things like getting and keeping a job, making friends or participating in a local community activity. NDIS participants control the support they receive, when they receive it, and who provides it.
What types of supports are funded?
The types of supports that the NDIS may fund for participants include:
daily personal activities
transport to enable participation in community, social, economic and daily life activities
workplace help to allow a participant to successfully get or keep employment in the open or supported labour market
therapeutic supports including behaviour support
help with household tasks to allow the participant to maintain their home environment
help to a participant by skilled personnel in aids or equipment assessment, set up and training
home modification design and construction
mobility equipment, and
vehicle modifications.
Find more information on types of funded supports
There are some kinds of supports that will not be funded or provided by the NDIS
The NDIS Act and the rules made under the NDIS Act also tell us which supports will not be funded by the NDIS.
The NDIS cannot fund a support that is:
the responsibility of another government system or community service
not related to a person’s disability
relates to day-to-day living costs that are not related to a participant's support needs, or
is likely to cause harm to the participant or pose a risk to others.
Find more information on types of funded supports.
What choice and control do I have over my funded supports?
You have choice and the control over how you use funded supports in your plan. That includes choice of how the supports are given and which service providers you use.
In some cases the NDIA or others will manage the funding for supports. For example, where there is an unreasonable risk to a participant.
Other community and government services
People who are not eligible for the NDIS can still get help to access
community and other government services
.
The NDIS can provide information and helps connect all people with disability, their families and carers to community and other government services.
For many people, this will be all the support they need.

6 - More information
Interpreting Services allow the transfer of communications from a person’s preferred spoken language into English. Interpreting Services are delivered by TIS National, on behalf of the NDIS.
TIS National contract more than 3,000 certified interpreters across Australia, in more than 160 different languages.
How to call the NDIS
You can call TIS National direct on 131 450 to ask to speak to the NDIS on 1800 800 110.
Understanding the NDIS
NDIS participants and carers are not charged for language interpreting services.
The interpreters’ role is to interpret spoken words only. This means they are unable to give you advice about the NDIS.
NDIS Planners, Early Childhood Early Intervention Services and Local Area Coordination Services can help you to get an interpreter.
Planning
Your NDIS Planner, Early Childhood Early Intervention Services, Local Area Coordination Services or Support Coordinator will book a certified interpreter for you.
You can bring a family member or friend who speaks English to your meeting, but the NDIS will also give you an interpreter.
Where possible, on-site interpreters will be booked to join your NDIS face-to-face meetings, while over the phone interpreter services will be used for short, simple communications.
The NDIS can provide a participant plan in your or your carers preferred language.
Using your NDIS Plan
Your NDIS Provider is responsible for offering you interpreter services to help you use the supports you have funded in your plan.
Your NDIS Provider or Support Coordinator will book a face-to-face or over the phone language support interpreter.
Language interpreting supports are not part of your NDIS plan.
You can ask your NDIS Provider to help book a specific interpreter every time you meet with them, for example, if you want the same interpreter or prefer a specific gender.
Registered NDIS Providers, including Support Coordinators, can register with TIS National to allow NDIS participants and their carers access to NDIS funded interpreters.
Aboriginal interpreting services in Northern Territory
Participants who want to know more about booking an aboriginal interpreter for any services delivered by a registered provider should speak to their LAC, planner, support coordinator or Remote Community Connector representative.

Defined programs
If you haven't received support before
On this page:
1 - Defined programs
2 - If you haven't received support before
If you currently get disability support services, the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) will contact you as the NDIS becomes available in your area.
Defined programs
If you are a Commonwealth, state or territory defined programs client, generally you will satisfy disability requirements without further evidence.
Your state or territory government will give us your contact details, then an NDIA representative will contact you to complete all the details you need to start your NDIS transition.
This may involve:
checking your identity or the identity of your representative
obtaining consent from you, or someone who has legal authority to act on your behalf, to become an NDIS participant
asking you to confirm some personal information including your name, age, where you live and whether you have permission to live in Australia permanently
obtaining your consent for the information to be verified through your Centrelink record
obtaining your consent to contact your health professionals, service providers and schools (where relevant), to collect information about you to help determine your eligibility. This information may also be used to help develop or implement your NDIS Plan if you become a participant.
The NDIA may also send you a letter requesting evidence of your disability. Find information on providing evidence and the treating health professionals that are best placed to provide assessments that are considered 'best practice' on the
Types of disability evidence page
.
If you haven't received support before
If you are not currently receiving any disability supports and the NDIS is available in your area, but wish to join the scheme, you will need to contact us to complete your access request.
If you think you are eligible for the NDIS, you can:
contact your local NDIS Office or local NDIS partner and ask them to support you to connect with local disability supports or apply to the NDIS if eligible.
phone the NDIS on 1800 800 110 to be supported to apply to the NDIS.
In some areas, we don’t have early childhood partners or local area coordination partners who can help you apply.
If you do not have access to a partner in your area, we recommend you contact the National Contact Centre on 1800 800 110 to be supported to apply to the NDIS.
If you do not have access to a partner, you can also download and complete the NDIS Access Request Form and email it to
[email protected]
with supporting information.

How do you ask for an internal review of a decision?
You must ask us to review the decision within three months from the day you receive our decision in writing.
There are a few ways you can ask us to review a decision.
You can:
complete the
Request for a Review of a Decision form
and send it to us
send us an email with supporting evidence to
[email protected]
call us on 1800 800 110
visit an
NDIS or partner office
.
You can also send a letter with supporting evidence to:
Chief Executive Officer
National Disability Insurance Agency
GPO Box 700
Canberra ACT 2601
Download the ‘Request for a review of a decision’ form
Request for a Review of a Decision form (PDF 134KB)
Request for a Review of a Decision form (DOCX 80KB)
.
What information should you provide?
When you request an internal review of a decision, you can let us know:
what decision you were expecting
why you think we should make a different decision
if there is any information you’ve already given us that you’d like us to reconsider
if you have any new evidence, such as medical or therapy reports, you’d like us to consider.
Information to support your request may include reports or letters that detail your disability and how it impacts you on a day-to-day basis.
Any new evidence can be provided to us as part of your request for a review of a decision.
Sometimes, we may need more information to review the decision. If we do, we’ll contact you to let you know what we need and why we need it.
Visit these pages on our website for more information about what to include with your request:
Types of disability evidence
Plan reassessment reports
Reasonable and necessary supports
.
Home and living supports
The NDIA may fund reasonable and necessary home and living supports, if they are unable to be met through mainstream, community, informal or other supports.
You can request these supports by completing the
Supporting Evidence Form – Home and Living
.
This form can be provided alongside a request for an internal review of a decision.
More information, including how to return this form, is available on the
Home and living supporting evidence
page.
How long does a request to review a decision take?
We aim to complete all internal reviews within 60 days from the day after we receive your request.
We will also provide you with reasons for our decisions in writing.
Find out more about the commitments we’ve made under our
Participant Service Guarantee
.
What if your situation or details have changed since we made the decision?
An internal review of a decision checks if we made the right decision under the law by looking at the facts and circumstances at the time of the internal review decision.
This means any changes that have happened since the original decision was made and any additional information can be considered as part of the internal review  decision.
It is important you let us know, if your situation and support needs have changed since our decision, you can
ask us to change your plan
.
If you’re a participant, and your situation changes while waiting for an internal review of a decision, we encourage you to contact us.
We’ll let you know what options are available, and how this might affect your plan and your internal review of a decision.
You can learn more by reading our
changing your plan guidelines
.
What if you are still not happy after we do an internal review of a decision?
Once we make the internal review decision, we can’t do another internal review on the same decision.
There are options available to you if you don’t agree with a decision we have made. This includes asking us to explain our decision, ways you can use your plan and how to access supports. For more information, visit
what other options are available to you?
on the
Request a review of a decision page
.
If you are not happy with the internal review decision, you can also ask the Administrative Review Tribunal to review it. We call this an external review.
You can’t ask for an external review until after we complete the internal review of a decision.
For more information about asking for an external review of an NDIS decision, check out the
Administrative Review Tribunal website
.
What if you have feedback about the decision-making process?
If you are not satisfied with how we carried out our decision-making, you can provide feedback or
make a complaint
.

Understanding your current supports
To get ready for your planning meeting, think about your current supports and who provides them, and what supports and services you may need to pursue your goals.
Preparing for your planning meeting
We recommend completing Booklet 2 - Creating your NDIS plan. You can choose to do it on your own or get someone to help, then bring it with you to your planning meeting.
You must also bring along any relevant reports or assessments. It helps us understand the types of supports you need.
Depending on your situation and support needs, there are different people to help you along the way.
Find out who can help you start your plan
.
Attending a planning meeting to create your plan
Attending a planning meeting, either in person, or over the phone, is the best way for us to gather all your information so together, we can develop the best plan for you.
During your planning meeting, make sure you discuss the goals/activities/tasks you want to pursue with your early childhood partner, LAC or NDIA planner.
Goals/activities/tasks are a really important part of your NDIS plan and we will ask you what you would like to work towards. It could be a goal to use public transport independently; a goal to help build your life skills so you can become more independent, or a goal to help
find, keep or change jobs
.
If you have any goals or any unmet needs in your current life and you would like them addressed, let us know. If your goals/activities/tasks are bigger, we can break them down into smaller goals and help you pursue those bigger goals. For more information, visit our
Learn more about planning to achieve your goals
page.
Receiving your approved NDIS plan
Your early childhood partner, LAC or NDIA planner will talk to you about how long it will take to get your approved NDIS plan and the steps you need to take next.
The NDIA must approve your NDIS plan initially, then once it is approved, your early childhood partner, LAC or NDIA planner will give it to you in person or mail a paper copy out to your preferred address.
Find out how long this takes in our
Participant Service Guarantee
.
Remember, during your planning conversation, you can ask for a copy of your plan in a variety of accessible formats. These include Braille, electronic text (on CD), large print or audio (on CD), or you can have it translated into your preferred language. For more information, visit our
Find out more about receiving your approved NDIS plan
page.
You can also view your plan on the myplace portal.
Using your plan
When you have an approved NDIS plan, you need to understand the different budgets and who can help you start using your plan, and how your plan is managed.
It is now up to you to choose what supports and services you feel you need to pursue your goals, who provides them and when and where they are delivered. For more information, visit our
Learn more about using your plan
page.
Changing your plan
We will contact you six weeks before your plan is due for reassessment. If you haven't heard from us, call 1800 800 110 or
find and contact an office in your area
.
As part of this call, we will check in with you and see how you are going with your current NDIS plan, and if your circumstances have changed in the last year.
This will help us prepare for your plan reassessment meeting, and make sure we have the information we need to make sure your plan reassessment experience is personalised to your needs.
You can have your plan reassessment meeting face-to-face, online or over the phone - whatever suits you best. You will also have the option to invite supports along to your check-in, such as a family member, friend or Support Coordinator.
Your plan reassessment is an opportunity to reflect on your last 12 months and what you have achieved.
Find out about the plan reassessment process
.
If your current plan reaches its reassessment date before your new plan is finalised, your current plan will be automatically extended for up to 12 months.
This means your current funding will automatically continue until your new plan can be finalised, because we don’t want you to have any gaps in your funding or support. Find out more about
automatic plan extensions
.

We will ask questions about how you are going in different areas of your life. This will help us to develop a plan that provides the right support for you.
The information you provide us will also be important for tracking the progress of the NDIS, and will help to improve the Scheme for everyone. If possible, we will also interview a family member, to see how they are going as well.

Top tips for preparing for your planning meeting
'
Examples of things you will be asked about in your first NDIS planning conversation
your personal details
your community and mainstream supports
how to manage every day activities
your safety, including equipment, accommodation or help to take care of yourself or your home
the goals you want to pursue
ways to manage your plan
the support you need to use your NDIS plan.
Phone planning meetings
Lots of planning meetings are done over the phone. Here are some tips to make sure that you get the most out of a phone planning meeting.
Before the phone meeting
Make sure you know when your phone appointment is, and who it will be with.
Find a quiet place to have the call where you can focus. Planning meetings can take over an hour depending on your situation.
Make sure you have your phone with you, it is charged and you are in a space with good reception.
Have any reports or assessments with you. If possible, send them to your early childhood partner, LAC or NDIA Planner before the call.
If you want a friend, family member or someone to help you with the meeting, make sure they are available and make sure that only one person talks at a time.
During the phone meeting
It’s ok to ask the person doing your planning meeting to stop, repeat, or explain things. We understand that sometimes it’s harder to communicate over the phone.
We need to check we are speaking to the right person so will ask you proof of identity questions.
We will guide you through the planning process, but take notes and ask any questions you have along the way.
Make sure you know what the next steps are before ending the call.
After the phone meeting
If there is anything important that you didn’t let us know, you can email or call your early childhood partner, LAC or NDIA Planner on the number they gave you.
Next steps
At the end of your planning conversation we'll talk about the next steps, including how your plan will be reviewed and how to start using the funding in your plan.
Find more resources about your plan meeting in accessible formats on the
booklets and factsheets page
.
For participants who will have an early childhood partner or LAC to support them to implement their plan:
An early childhood partner or Local Area Coordinator (LAC) from an NDIS partner organisation will be in contact with you to discuss your plan, help you access supports and talk about your goals with you.
For participants who receive help from a Support Coordinator to implement their plan:
Your plan will include funding for a Support Coordinator to help you implement your plan. Once your plan is approved, this person will contact you to discuss your plan, help you access supports and discuss how you will work towards your goals.
For participants who are self-managing their NDIS plan:
You will be contacted by the NDIS once your plan is approved and we will talk to you or your nominee about the opportunities and responsibilities of self-managing your plan.
Mobility Allowance
Mobility Allowance provides financial assistance for people with disability, illness or injury aged 16 years or over who cannot use public transport without substantial assistance and need to travel to and from their home for work (including volunteer work), training or job seeking.
Centrelink directly pays the allowance to recipients.
When you become an NDIS participant, your plan will include any supports the NDIS will fund. This includes any reasonable and necessary transport-related funded supports, this means you will no longer be eligible for Centrelink's Mobility Allowance because the NDIS may cover those Mobility Allowance costs in your NDIS plan.
You need to advise Centrelink when your NDIS plan is approved. If you don't tell Centrelink within 14 days you may be over paid.
If you have a Health Care Card, you still get to keep it. Nothing changes there.
For more information on Mobility Allowance, visit the
Services Australia website
Continence Aids Payment Scheme
The Continence Aids Payment Scheme (CAPS) provides a payment to eligible people to assist with some of the costs of their continence products.
Services Australia (formerly the Department of Human Services) directly pays the payment to eligible customers, or on behalf of eligible customers to an authorised, legal or payment representative or organisation.
When you become an NDIS participant, your plan will include any supports the NDIS will fund. This includes any reasonable and necessary continence-related funded supports, which means you may no longer get the Continence Aids Payment Scheme payment because the NDIS may now cover these continence products costs in your NDIS plan.
For more information on the Continence Aids Payment Scheme,
visit the Bladder Bowel website
.

Plan management is when a provider supports you to manage funding in your NDIS plan. These providers are known as plan managers.
Plan management is different from having the NDIA manage funding in your NDIS plan, or you choosing to self-manage your plan. More information on
ways to manage your funding
.
NDIS Guide to Plan Management
To help you understand plan management, we have released the NDIS Guide to Plan Management, with an Easy Read translation:
NDIS Guide to Plan Management (PDF 3.6MB)
Easy Read - NDIS Guide to Plan Management (PDF 7.1MB)
This guide will help you to understand:
what to expect from plan management
the roles, responsibilities and activities of plan management providers
the broader system plan management providers operate under.
Why use a plan manager?
A plan manager can help you:
increase your financial and plan management skills
learn how to self-manage your plan
pay providers
increase your choice of providers
get NDIS plan budget reports and greater budget oversight.
How can I have plan management?
At your planning meeting you can tell NDIS staff that you would like a plan manager to support you.
The NDIS will include funding in your plan to pay for your plan manager. This is separate from your other services and supports in your budget.
If you are mid-plan and want to change, contact us on 1800 800 110 to discuss how you can include plan management in your plan.
How do I find and connect with a plan manager?
You can find and connect with a plan manager through:
your Local Area Coordinator, early childhood partner or support coordinator
the Provider Finder tool on the
NDIS myplace participant portal
your friends and family
other online resources and websites.
After I have connected with a plan manager, what do I do?
Once you have connected with a plan manager, you should create a
service agreement
.
A service agreement outlines:
the services to be provided
how these services will be provided
how long they will be your plan manager.
How do I change plan managers?
You can choose your plan manager. You can also change your plan manager during your plan.
If you wish to change, you will need to tell your plan manager. They will provide you with information about your plan and help you to change.
Complaints and feedback
If you have a complaint with the service of your plan manager, start by having a discussion with your plan manager. They may be able to resolve the issue.
If you are not happy with that outcome or you do not want to discuss the matter with your plan manager, you may lodge a complaint with the
NDIS Commission
.
Frequently asked questions
Should a plan manager advise you when NDIS funds are low?
Yes, a plan manager should provide regular reports and statements to you directly.
When a plan manager has identified overspend or underspend, the plan manager should advise you as soon as possible, regardless of reporting frequency.
Should a plan manager advise a provider when NDIS funds are low?
No, a plan manager should contact you directly.
This will allow you to contact your provider, support coordination provider or partner in the community, to discuss current service delivery arrangements and make any required amendments.
How long should it take a plan manager to pay a provider?
A plan manager should arrange for prompt payment to a provider or prompt reimbursement to you.
The NDIA expects a plan manager to validate an invoice and submit a payment request to the NDIA within five business days of receipt.
Upon receiving payment from the NDIS, the NDIA expects payment or reimbursement to occur within two business days.
Should my plan manager claim all plan funds at the start of my plan?
No, a plan manager can only submit claims for supports and services after they have been provided.
Once an invoice or receipt has been issued and sent to a plan manager, they will make a claim for that amount from the NDIS.
All plan funds remain with the NDIS until a plan manager submits a claim for that amount.
Should invoices for supports and services include the provider’s ABN?
Yes. If your provider is registered for an ABN, their invoice must display a valid ABN.
If you are providing an invoice without an ABN to your plan manager, your provider must complete the ATO’s Statement by a supplier not quoting an ABN form.
Should a plan manager help to determine whether supports or services are ‘reasonable and necessary’?
No, the role of a plan manager is not to determine whether the supports or services purchased are ‘reasonable and necessary’.
Your plan will have funds approved for reasonable and necessary supports at the planning stage.
The role of the plan manager is to ensure your plan is implemented as intended. This includes ensuring funds are being spent in accordance with your plan.
Why do plan managers operate differently to each other? Why isn’t there a set of standards to follow?
Plan managers are expected to follow payments and price controls established by the NDIA.
Plan managers are also expected to follow the service expectations set out in the NDIS Guide to Plan Management. The guide does not prescribe what services a plan manager should provide, so the services offered may vary.
Who is responsible if a provider submits an invoice to a plan manager and there are not enough funds available?
Plan managers should work with you to reduce any potential for plan overspend. This will involve regular reporting of plan managed budgets as outlined in the NDIS Guide to Plan Management.
Your plan manager should discuss with you effective and efficient ways to utilise approved funds.
If your NDIS plan funds are being spent faster than anticipated and there is a risk that funds will be exhausted before your next review, your plan manager should discuss this with you.
If you require additional funding (for example, due to a change in circumstances), contact us to discuss your options.
Who is liable to repay any amounts that are not spent in accordance with your plan?
Inappropriate use of government funds or fraud are serious matters.
A plan manager may be liable to repay any amounts which have not be spent in accordance with your plan.
For more information see the
Provider Payment Assurance Program
.
Why can’t a provider be advised of the allocated plan management funds in my plan?
Providers should work closely with you to develop a service agreement. The service agreement should outline how and when the supports will be delivered.
Your plan manager should report regularly to you on your plan spending. This reporting will help you to keep providers advised.
If I change plan manager, who is responsible for paying my ‘old’ invoices?
If you change your plan manager, the new plan manager becomes responsible for the ongoing management of your plan.
This includes, to process payments on your behalf, irrespective of the date the services were rendered or the invoice date. This is to ensure that any late invoices issued by a provider from earlier in the plan period are able to be paid.
The NDIA expects payments of this kind will only be required in special circumstances.
What is the difference between a plan manager and a support coordinator and a partner in the community?
A plan manager will pay providers for supports delivered. A plan manager will help you monitor your funds, and provide financial reporting.
A support coordinator will support you to understand and implement supports included in your plan. A support coordinator will link you to providers and other community and government services. A support coordinator will also support you to build skills and direction.
An NDIS Partner in the Community delivering
Local Area Coordination
or
early childhood services
may provide plan implementation and monitoring support to you. Partner organisations are appointed by the NDIA to help you understand the NDIS, and find providers of support suited to your needs.
Can I pay my providers more than the limits set in the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits?
No. If you are using a Plan Manager, providers cannot charge more than the price limits outlined in the
NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits
.
What other costs can plan managers charge?
From 1 July 2020, plan managers can claim for supports not delivered in person. This includes travel costs incurred to deliver supports.
More information is in the
Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits
.

When your plan is managed by the NDIA (sometimes referred to as Agency-managed):
You are able to choose from a range of NDIS registered providers.
Your providers claim payment electronically from your funding.
You cannot use unregistered providers.
You can look on the myplace portal to see what claims providers are making against your NDIS funding and keep track of your budget.
The NDIA will manage your book-keeping and records of your spending.

Early childhood partners
Families and carers of children younger than 9 who have an NDIS funded plan will work with an early childhood partner. Early childhood partners have experience working with children with disability or developmental delay. The NDIS early childhood approach is based on the principles of best practice in early childhood intervention to achieve better long-term outcomes for children.
Find out more about early childhood partners
.
Local area coordinator (LAC)
Most NDIS participants over 9 years of age will have an LAC to help them understand and use their plan. This includes showing participants how to use the
myplace portal
and connecting them with funded supports. LACs support participants throughout their plans to monitor how the plan is going, and they can check progress regularly.
Early childhood partners and LACs come from organisations in your local community, which work with the NDIA to deliver the NDIS.
Find out more about LACs
.
Support coordinator
If early childhood or LAC partners are not available in your area, or you need more help coordinating your supports and services, the NDIA may fund a support coordinator in your NDIS funded plan. A support coordinator will help you use your plan to work towards your goals, live more independently, increase your skills and be included in your community and in employment.
Specialist support coordination is a higher level of support coordination. It is an option for people whose situations are more complex and who need specialist help to coordinate their supports and services.
Find out more about support coordination
.
Implementation meeting
We will ask if you want to meet and talk about how to use your plan. Your My NDIS Contact can arrange this for you after we approve your plan.
Find out how long this takes in our
Participant Service Guarantee
.
Before the meeting you might like to:
ask someone you trust to come with you, such as a family member, friend or carer
check we have your bank account details, if you
self-manage
your funding
write down any questions or concerns you have.
There are some things you might like to find out about before the meeting. If this is your first plan, these might be new to you. We can explain these things at the implementation meeting:
the
myplace portal
what you can and can’t buy with your funding
supports you can get outside the NDIS, like
informal, community and mainstream supports
.
how to find service providers
service agreements
and
service bookings

What's in your plan?
How your early childhood partner, LAC or Support Coordinator can help you use your plan
Our guideline
On this page:
1 - What's in your plan?
2 - How your early childhood partner, LAC or Support Coordinator can help you use your plan
3 - Our guideline
The NDIS allows you to have as much choice and control as possible over the supports funded or provided in your NDIS plan.
Your early childhood partner, LAC or Support Coordinator will help you start your NDIS plan.
What's in your plan?
Your NDIS plan will be based on the discussion you had in your planning meeting.
Your plan will include the following information:
Information about you
This section includes basic information about your disability, your day-to-day activities, where you live, who you live with, or who cares for you.
Family and friends
This section includes information about the support you get from family and friends that is not funded but will help you pursue your goals.
Services and community groups
This section includes information about services and supports funded and delivered by community or other government services like support groups, health centres, libraries and public transport.
Your goals
This section includes the current goals you would like to pursue as part of your plan and the long-term goals you have identified for your life. Goal-setting is an important part of the NDIS. The supports you receive may help you pursue the goals in your NDIS plan.
Funded supports
This section tells you what funding you have been allocated in each support category and what this funding is for. You may not have all the support categories funded in your plan. Some people might have one or two support categories funded and others may have more.
This will depend on your individual needs and may change from plan to plan based on the supports and services you need. Your funding is based on what is reasonable and necessary for your needs, in addition to the support provided by family, friends and other community and government services that you need to live your life. You must only use your NDIS funding on supports and services that are related to your disability.
Find out more about support categories in your support budgets in
Managing your budget
.
How your early childhood partner, LAC or Support Coordinator can help you use your plan
Your early childhood partner, LAC or Support Coordinator will help you start your NDIS plan.
They can help you:
understand your plan and what supports and services you can pay for with your NDIS funding
learn what is the responsibility of other services, such as the health or education systems, or your state or territory government
connect with community and other government services
find providers who meet your needs and will help you achieve your goals
put service agreements and service bookings in place with your providers
as point of contact if you have questions, concerns or something in your life changes.

Your NDIS plan is yours.
You can choose who you share the details of your plan with, including if you would like to share your plan with anyone other than your providers, for example with a doctor or family member.
You or your nominee have the option to share parts of your plan with providers who have an active service booking with you.
You can provide consent through the myplace portal or by visiting an NDIA or partner office.
If you agree to share your plan with providers they will be able to see basic plan details including your name, NDIS number, date of birth and your goals.
It's important to remember that it is your decision to allow providers to access parts of your plan if providers demand access to your plan. You may choose to share your information with some providers and not others.
If you have a Plan Manager you will be able to agree for them to see your NDIS budget in addition to the basic plan details. If you work with a Support Coordinator you will also be able to agree for them see additional details in the 'About Me' and 'My Supports' sections of your plan as well as your NDIS budget and the basic plan details.
Providers you do not have a service booking with will not be able to see your plan.

Self-management is when you manage your NDIS funding. It gives you the flexibility and choice to decide what NDIS supports you buy to pursue your plan goals.
It lets you think creatively about how you can use your funds to best meet your needs.

The benefits of self-managing
If you self-manage your NDIS funding, you will have:
choice to decide what NDIS supports you purchase, who provides these supports, and how they’re delivered – as long as it’s an NDIS support in line with your plan
flexibility to use both registered and unregistered NDIS providers that will best help you meet your needs and pursue your goals
power to negotiate costs above or below the
NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits
so you can arrange your NDIS supports in a way that offers you the best value
capacity to directly employ or contract staff, or have someone like a nominee employ staff on your behalf, so they can provide your NDIS supports
control over and responsibility for your NDIS funding so you understand and manage your budget, arrange and pay for your NDIS supports and keep the records and receipts
ability to be innovative when arranging your NDIS supports. We encourage you to shop around to work out which NDIS supports give you the best value and meet your needs and preferences.
Video: The benefits of self-managing your plan
In this video, we discuss the benefits of self-managing your plan, including more choice and control with your NDIS supports and how to get the most out of your NDIS funding. Participants Chantel, Emma, Steve and Taryn, mum of a participant all share their experience in self-managing plans.

Responsibilities of self-managing
If you are thinking about self-managing you need to understand that there are responsibilities involved. The responsibilities of self-managing your NDIS funding include to:
buy
NDIS supports
for you. You can only spend your funding on NDIS supports. NDIS supports are the supports the NDIS laws say we can fund
spend in line with your plan. This includes spending in line with any funding periods or funding component amounts. Read more about these in
Our Guideline – Creating your plan
make agreements with your providers about the supports you’ll receive, including how they’ll be provided and paid for
manage your funding so the costs of NDIS supports give you value for money, and can be met within your budget for the length of your plan and any funding periods. This means the cost is reasonable when you think about the benefit you’ll get, and you can afford to pay for the support within your plan budget
pay for NDIS supports on time, by making accurate claims with all required information within our timeframes, receiving funding and paying providers
keep records of invoices and receipts for 5 years to show that you’ve purchased NDIS supports and used your funding in line with your NDIS plan
meet your obligations as an employer if you choose to employ staff directly. This includes understanding the NDIS Code of Conduct that applies to workers and providers who deliver NDIS supports
cooperate with payment reviews when you’re asked to provide invoices, receipts or other evidence to show the NDIA that you’ve spent your funding on NDIS supports and in line with your NDIS plan
advise us of any significant changes in your situation that may mean you can’t meet your responsibilities as a self-manager. If you’re a nominee, you need to tell us about any conflict of interest you have in relation to the participant, and how you’ll manage this. For example, if you provide the participant with services you get paid for.
Spending in line with your plan
Spending in line with your plan means only spending your funding on the supports included in your plan. To spend in line with your plan, you need to:
spend your funding in the way we describe. This includes any stated supports, where we describe the supports you can buy more specifically
make sure your funding will last for the whole length of your plan
if your plan includes funding periods and funding component amounts, make sure your funding will last for the length of each funding period.
When you buy supports in line with your plan, you need to make sure NDIS they’re NDIS supports or an agreed replacement support that relates to your disability.
You can still self-manage your funding even if you need some help to meet these responsibilities.
Directly employing your own staff
When you self-manage your plan, you can choose to directly employ your own staff.
Directly employing your staff can give you more control over who works with you, but you also have more responsibilities.

Your early childhood partner, local area coordinator or the NDIA can explain how to request changes to your plan and can also put you in touch with advocates who can help you with these processes.
If you have asked for a reassessment, you can continue to use your plan while you wait for the decision.
Change in circumstances
If your personal circumstances change significantly and this affects the supports you need from the NDIS, you can request a plan reassessment at any time by completing the change of circumstances form.
Find out more about
change in circumstances
.
Internal review of a decision
If you are unhappy with a decision about the funding in your plan you can
request a review of the plan decision
.
Administrative Review Tribunal
If you're unhappy with your internal review you can apply for a review by the
Administrative Review Tribunal
, which exists outside the NDIA.
The Administrate Review Tribunal began on 14 October 2024. It replaced the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).
You can’t ask the Tribunal to review a decision by the NDIA before there has been an internal review by the NDIA.
NDIS Appeals
NDIS Appeals has been set up by the
Department of Social Services
to ensure that all people with disability, and other people affected by
reviewable decisions
of the NDIA, have access to support when seeking review of those decisions in the Administrative Review Tribunal.
There are two types of supports available via NDIS Appeals:
access to a skilled disability advocate who acts as a support person, and
access to funding for legal services, where a case raises complex or novel legal issues.
Support Persons are National Disability Advocacy Program (NDAP) disability advocates. Find out more about
NDIS Appeals

What is myplace?
The NDIS participant portal is called myplace.
It is a secure website portal on the Australian Government’s myGov website where you or a person you trust (a nominee or child representative) can access your NDIS information.
What can I do on the myplace portal?
See your current plan and previous plans.
Check your contact details.
See messages from the NDIS.
Create and view payment requests.
Create and manage service bookings.
Upload documents, including assessments or service agreements.
Share your plan, or parts of your plan, with your service providers.
Find service providers.
How do I access myplace?
You will need a myGov account to sign in to myplace.
If you already have a myGov account for other government services such as Medicare, the Australian Taxation Office or Centrelink, you can use the same myGov account for the NDIS.
Visit
myGov
to find out how to
create your myGov account
.
When you link the my NDIS participant portal to your myGov account for the first time, you will need to enter an NDIS activation code.
This one-time 6-digit SMS code will be sent to the mobile phone number listed in your account. If you can’t get the SMS for any reason, you can contact the NDIS on 1800 800 110 (Monday – Friday, 8am - 8pm).
It is important that you access the portal myplace as soon as possible after you receive your activation code, as the code will expire within 24 hours.
Please note each NDIS portal account can only be linked to one myGov account. Each person must link using their own NDIS number and myGov account. Using someone else's NDIS number (such as another Child Representative, Plan Nominee or Participant's) will result in an error message.

myplace hints and tips
What Internet browser is best to use?
Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Safari and Firefox are the most compatible with the myplace portals. Download these browsers so you can use all the functionality of myplace.
Understanding a Service Agreement and Service Bookings
A Service Agreement is an agreement between a participant and a provider (usually written), it sets out the expectations for what types of services will be delivered. They do not appear in the myplace portal.
Service Bookings are used to reserve plan budget for products or services to be delivered by a provider, and are required so a provider can request payment in the myplace portal. Service Bookings are like a request for a service.
Plan information
Participants should check their plan and Service Booking information and contact their local NDIS office if information looks incorrect. The NDIA will then update the information on your behalf.
Participant Satisfaction Survey
We’d like to know about your experience with the NDIS.
We’re inviting participants, their families and carers to tell us about their recent contact with the NDIS.
To let us know about your experience with us please log in to the myplace Participant Portal and go to the ‘complete survey’ link in the bottom right hand corner of the page. The survey should only take about 5 minutes to complete.
The survey collects information about your recent experience with the NDIS.
This information will support the Agency to measure the level of satisfaction with people’s NDIA experience.
The results of the survey are used to improve NDIA services.
Responses are private, and any identifying data is removed. We will not reply individually to people who complete the survey.
New my NDIS portal
We’re introducing a new computer system and some improvements to the way we deliver the NDIS. Find out about

Asking for a change to your plan
We will only reassess a NDIS plan if there is a change in your life that means you need more, less or different supports, or your plan is coming to an end.
We do not automatically review plans because they are fully spent.
When you ask us for a change, we will work with you to understand why you need it, to work out whether it meets our guidelines for a reassessment. We can only agree to review your plan if you provide the right evidence to support the change.
Without the evidence we cannot update your plan.
Our rules say that:
Every change we make must meet
our guidelines
.
The change must be
reasonable and necessary
and for the kinds of support
we would fund
.
You need to have evidence to support the change.
While you wait for us to start this work, you can use your plan flexibly.
Read more about
plan reassessments
.
Urgent changes in circumstances
Urgent means you are in a critical situation, with a significant change to your personal circumstances or living arrangements, or there is a risk to you.
If you need a plan reassessment because you are in a critical situation, you can call us on 1800 800 110. We will prioritise plan reassessments for participants with urgent changes in critical situations.
We will still ask you to provide the right evidence to support your review.
Making the most of your plan - using your plan flexibly
If you have asked us to change your plan and are waiting for us to assess your request, we encourage you to continue to use your Core support budget, within your existing plan funding, flexibly to access the required disability related supports.
It's important to remember that Core funding can be used flexibly with other Core support types and not with other support types like Capacity Building.
Talk to your my NDIS contact or your NDIS partner if you need some help to use your current plan flexibly.
If you have an NDIS plan in our old computer system, your budget will have 3 support categories.
If your NDIS plan is in our new computer system, your budget will have 4 support categories.
Some of these categories include stated supports. When a support is stated, this means you can only spend your plan funds on the supports described. You can decide how you spend your funds on these supports, but you can’t use these funds to buy different supports.
Other supports can be flexible. This means you can use your flexible funds to buy the kinds of supports you think will best help you work towards your goals or meet your needs, while you wait for us to come back to you on the change you’ve asked for.
You must make sure that the kind of supports you decide to buy are
reasonable and necessary
. They must be the kinds of supports you are allowed to buy with your NDIS funds.
You can read more about support categories and budgets further down on this page.
If you have previously asked for changes to your plan and your situation becomes critical while you are waiting for your plan reassessment, please call us on 1800 800 110 with your reference number so we can prioritise your request.
NDIS applications
If you are waiting for us to assess your application to join the NDIS, you can talk to your NDIS partner about the community and mainstream services available to you. These supports are available to everyone.
Your NDIS partner can help you learn about and make connections in your area.
If you child is younger than 9, you can talk to an Early Childhood Partner about early connections
Support budgets
There are three types of support budgets that may be funded in your NDIS plan:
Core Supports budget
Capacity Building Supports budget
Capital Supports budget
Transcript for '
Types of Support Budgets
'
Core Supports budget
Core Supports help you with everyday activities, your current disability-related needs and to work towards your goals. Your Core Supports budget is the most flexible, and in most cases, you can use your funding across any of the following four support categories. However, there are instances where you do not have flexibility in your funding, particularly for transport funding.
In your plan
In the myplace portal
Description
Assistance with Daily Life
Daily Activities
For example, assistance with everyday needs, household cleaning and/or yard maintenance.
Consumables
Consumables
Everyday items you may need. For example, continence products or low-cost assistive technology and equipment to improve your independence and/or mobility.
Assistance with Social & Community Participation
Social, community and civic participation
For example, a support worker to assist you to participate in social and community activities.
Transport
Transport
This is support that helps you travel to work or other places that will help you pursue the goals in your plan.
How you can spend your transport funding and how it is paid to you (whether upfront or in regular payments) will be different for each person. Your LAC will explain how you can use this budget.
Case study
Charlotte’s goals are to learn to be more independent in her daily life and to make friends. She has funding in her Core Supports budget to help her with tasks like getting dressed and cooking meals. Over time, Charlotte feels confident to reduce the amount of support she needs in the morning to get dressed and make breakfast. Because Charlotte’s Core Supports budget is flexible, she decides to reduce the amount of one-on-one support she receives in the morning and uses the funding for support to take part in a group recreational swimming activity once a week.
Capacity Building Supports budget
Capacity Building Supports help build your independence and skills to help you pursue your goals. Unlike your Core Supports budget, your Capacity Building Supports budget cannot be moved from one support category to another. Funding can only be used to purchase approved individual supports that fall within that Capacity Building category. The Capacity Building categories are:

Capital Supports budget

It is important to remember that funds within the Capital Supports budget can only be used for their specific purpose and cannot be used to pay for anything else. The Capital Supports budget has two support categories: Assistive Technology and Home Modifications.
Transcript for '
Capital Supports Budget
'
In your plan
In the myplace portal
Description
Assistive Technology
Assistive Technology
This includes equipment items for mobility, personal care, communication and recreational inclusion such as wheelchairs or vehicle modifications.
Home Modifications
Home Modifications
Home modifications such as installation of a hand rail in a bathroom, or Specialist Disability Accommodation for participants who require special housing because of their disability.
Other information
Stated supports – not flexible
Services listed as ‘stated supports’ are not flexible. This means funding has been allocated for a specific support or service, and you can’t use this funding for something else. You cannot swap ‘stated supports’ for any other supports.
In-kind supports – pre-paid
If there are supports in your plan that are listed as ‘in-kind’, it means the service has already been paid for by your state, territory or the Australian government.
hen you use an in-kind service your existing provider will deliver your in-kind supports and you will not need to pay from them with your NDIS plan funds. Talk to your ECEI Coordinator, LAC or NDIA planner if you have a concern about using a specific in-kind provider or service.
More information on in-kind supports is available on the
In-kind supports - participants page
.
Quote required
Where a support is listed as ‘quote required’ additional information such as quotes and/or specialist reports will be required before funding can be made available in your plan.
Mobility allowance
When you become a participant in the NDIS your plan will include any supports that the NDIS will fund, including any reasonable and necessary transport-related funded supports.
If you are receiving Mobility Allowance when you receive an approved NDIS plan, your eligibility for the Mobility Allowance payment ceases.
You cannot receive Mobility Allowance once you have a plan with the NDIS. However you will keep your Health Care Card if you have one.
For more information on Mobility Allowance visit the
Services Australia website
Find more resources about support categories in your plan in accessible formats on the
booklets and factsheets page

We understand your situation or details may change, or you may want to ask for a plan reassessment.
It’s important you let us know if your situation changes or you need to update your details, because it might affect:
your plan

You must also let us know if something will change in the future. Changes don’t always mean we’ll do a plan reassessment. But you must still let us know about changes as soon as you reasonably can.
What changes should you tell us about?
The changes you should tell us about include:
your contact details, such as your address, phone number or email
the support your family and friends provide

you’re starting a new job and need new or different support at work
you’re going overseas for a long period of time, or you’re moving overseas
you’re moving out of residential accommodation or aged care, and you need different support in your new home
you receive or claim compensation for an accident or illness related to your disability.

Your Plan
’ has information about when you need to tell us about changes in your life and when you can request a plan reassessment.

What is a provider?
A provider is a person, business or organisation who delivers NDIS funded supports to participants. Providers have different areas of experience and expertise.
It's important to find the right providers to meet your needs. Providers can be large companies, charities, small not-for-profits, sole traders, or any other type of business.
NDIS registered providers are regulated by the
NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission
. All providers (registered or unregistered) must adhere to the NDIS Code of Conduct.
If your NDIS funding is NDIA-managed, you can only use NDIS registered providers to deliver your services.
Participants who self-manage or have a plan manager to manage their NDIS plan funding can use NDIS registered providers or unregistered providers.
More information about how to
find a registered provider
.
Find more resources about working with providers in accessible formats on the
booklets and factsheets page
.
Your first meeting with a provider
Below are some things to think about before your first meeting with a provider. They may help you to decide whether the provider and the supports and services they provide are right for you.
You may be able to find some answers before your meeting by looking at the provider’s website or talking to the person who made the appointment for you. You can also ask the provider at the meeting.
You don’t have to get answers for all these questions, and you may have other questions you want to ask.
You may want to write them down, so you don’t forget.
How will this support help you with your disability-related needs?
If you have received this support before, do you still need it/is it still helping you?
Does your NDIS plan include funding for this support?
How often do you want this support? How long is the appointment?
What days do you want this support?
What experience does the person who will give you the service have with your disability?
How much will this support cost? (If self-managed, how does this price compare to the NDIS maximum price?)
Are there other costs, like travel costs or report writing costs?
Can the provider work with you when you need them to?
How long does the provider think you will need the support?
How can you get the most out of these supports?
What do you need to bring to the session?
How often will the provider review with you about whether the support is helping you?
What experience does the provider/therapist have with the NDIS?
If self-managed, how do you pay the provider – do they send an invoice and receipt?
If plan-managed, do you need to do something for your plan manager to pay the provider?
What do you want to know about the support?
How can you change to a different support or stop the support when you don’t need it anymore?
We have created tip sheets with these questions that you can download:
Before your first meeting with a provider (PDF 266KB)
Before your first meeting with a provider (DOCX 57KB)
Your first meeting with a provider (PDF 328KB)
Your first meeting with a provider (DOCX 60KB)
.
After your meeting you can think about the information the provider has given you. You can talk with someone you trust to see how the service fits with your plan.
You might want to use the tip sheet:
Compare providers or equipment (PDF 457KB)
Compare providers or equipment (DOCX 46KB)
.
If you have a plan manager, you can talk with them about your NDIS funding.
Depending on what supports are approved in your plan, you might decide to use fewer services with one provider so you can get other services with another provider.
You might like to use a
basic calculator
or
support organiser (XLSX 30KB)
to help you decide.
It’s important that you are comfortable with the way you
communicate with your provider
.
You could talk face-to-face, email or text, or you could talk on the phone or have a video call. You can let them know your preferred way to engage with them.

What is a provider?
A provider is an individual or organisation delivering a support or a product to an NDIS participant. Organisations or individuals can apply to be a registered NDIS provider with the
NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission
(NDIS Commission).
Under the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, registered providers must meet the NDIS Practice Standards. Both registered and unregistered providers must adhere to the NDIS Code of Conduct.
Further information can be found on the
NDIS Commission’s website
.
Is a provider right for me?
Once you’ve found the types of services that may help you achieve your goals, it’s time to find out more about the providers in your area and whether they are right for you. Your early childhood partner, local area coordinator or support coordinator can help you.
Before you agree to work with a provider, you might want to research their services on the internet, check reviews, get advice from friends or family and speak with different providers either face-to-face or over the phone.
To help you, we have put some suggestions into tip sheets:
Finding new providers or supports (PDF 113KB)
Finding new providers or supports (DOCX 59KB)
Before your first meeting with a provider (PDF 266KB)
Before your first meeting with a provider (DOCX 57KB)
Provider wait lists
Sometimes, the provider you would like to work with will tell you they have a waiting list. This means they don’t have time to work with you right now.
Putting your name down on a wait list means the provider will contact you when they have time to work with you. If a provider tells you they have a wait list, you could ask them:
How long before you can get a first appointment?
Can you put your name down now?
Can you take your name off the wait list later?
Can you put your name down and work with other providers while you are waiting?
Will the provider contact you when there is an appointment for you?
Things to think about:
Do you want to wait to get an appointment?
How will waiting for an appointment impact you?
Are there other supports that will help you pursue your goals?
Could you use a similar kind of support until you are able to get an appointment with the provider you have chosen?
You can talk with other providers to see if they can help you.
We have a tip sheet for Provider wait lists
that you can download:
Provider wait lists (PDF 265KB)
Provider wait lists (DOCX 58KB)
The
Guides for understanding supports
can help you think about other supports that will help you reach your goals.
Find a service provider
To find NDIS registered providers you can search the
Provider Finder here
or when you are on the
myplace portal
.
The Provider finder animation explains how to use the Provider finder.
Transcript for '

Sharing your plan
You do not have to give anyone a copy of your NDIS plan. Sharing your plan is your choice.
You can choose to share parts or all of your plan with your service providers through the
myplace portal
.
You may want to share information about your goals, so providers know what you want to work towards and how you would like them to help you.
NDIS registered providers must follow privacy rules and should not share your personal information without your permission.
If you have concerns about privacy, speak to your provider about their privacy policy and rules.

On this page:
1 - Who decides how much a provider can charge?
2 - Where can I find the pricing arrangements and price limits?
3 - Your rights when you are paying for services and supports
The NDIA is responsible for setting price limits for many of the supports that your providers deliver.
Pricing arrangements are the rules around when and how a provider can claim for supports and services from your NDIS funds.
Our price limits and pricing arrangements help you get reasonable value for money from your plan funds.
Who decides how much a provider can charge?
The NDIA sets price limits for some of the supports included in your plan. The price limit is the maximum price that a registered provider can charge you for your NDIS funded disability support or service.
Providers decide their prices based on the cost of delivering supports or services. The NDIA does not set the prices that providers charge you. You can negotiate with your provider and they cannot charge you more than the price limit.
In general, providers shouldn’t charge you more than they do for anyone else for the same support. If they do, then need to let you know the reasons for the difference.
If your plan is NDIA-managed or plan-managed, your provider must follow NDIS pricing arrangements and price limits. Self-managed participants can use registered or unregistered providers and are not subject to the pricing arrangements.
Recent changes to price limits and pricing arrangements are explained on the
Understanding pricing changes page
.
Where can I find the pricing arrangements and price limits?
The NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits is the document that explains our pricing rules and the way that price controls for supports and services work in the NDIS.
NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits set out:
general claiming rules
different types of
support budget in your plan
support categories and how they align to your goals or outcomes.
The NDIS Support Catalogue lists the specific supports, sometimes called ‘support items’ that have a maximum price.
The Support Catalogue also lists helpful things like:
support item numbers, sometimes called ‘codes’
the date a support was introduced and if it has ended
if a support needs a quote
which supports allow your provider to claim their travel costs from your plan
when a provider can claim non-face-to-face costs for a support
when a provider is allowed to charge more for delivering a support in a remote or very remote area.
You can download the latest NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits and Support Catalogue from the
Pricing page
.
Your rights when you are paying for services and supports
When you buy goods and services including disability-related purchases, you have rights under law.
The
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
has information about your rights and where to go for help, including:

What is a service agreement?
When you agree to use your NDIS budget to pay for supports, you are entering into a contract with your provider.
A service agreement is an agreement between you and your provider that makes it clear what you have both agreed to. It is covered by Australian Consumer Law.
The NDIA recommends having a written service agreement so participants and providers are clear about what each party has agreed to. For example, what supports will be delivered and how they will be delivered.
Making a service agreement is a negotiation between you and your provider. You can ask another person to help you do this, such as a family member or friend.
Your provider may have a standard service agreement that you may like to use, or you can create your own.
Providers should support you to understand any service agreement using the language and
way of communicating
you understand.
A written service agreement must be in place for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) supports under the NDIS.
For other supports, the NDIA does not require a written service agreement.
The NDIA may review service agreements between providers and participants as part of a compliance review to ensure services are provided in line with what's been agreed with the participant.
Things to consider when making a service agreement
When you negotiate a service agreement, you should understand things like:
what supports are being provided
the cost of the supports
the responsibilities of your provider
your responsibilities
how long the agreement goes for and how it can be changed
the dispute resolution process.
Things to think about when making a service agreement (PDF 182KB)
and
Making a Service Agreement: Things to think about – Easy Read (PDF 4MB)
can help you when you are thinking about what to include when making a service agreement.

Service bookings are used to set aside funding for an NDIS registered provider for a support they will deliver. Service bookings are not the same as service agreements.
A service booking should only cover the supports that you and your provider have agreed to.
Registered providers claim payments against the service booking on the
myplace portal
. A service booking will show the type of support to be provided, the length of time it is needed, and sets aside funding to pay for the support or service.
Service bookings can be made by your NDIS registered provider on the myplace portal. You can also make the service booking - you can find out how to do this by using the
myplace portal step-by-step guides
.
If your NDIS funds are self-managed - you don’t need to use service bookings because you pay your providers directly.
If your NDIS funds are plan-managed - your plan manager will make one service booking on the myplace portal, which allows the plan manager to claim payment from the NDIS for all services and supports in your plan. In this case, both NDIS registered and unregistered providers can be included in the service booking.
If your NDIS funds are NDIA-managed - you will need to give your NDIS registered service providers your NDIS number, date of birth and surname and the relevant support areas you have been funded for, so your providers can receive payment. You need to have service bookings in place so your provider can claim payment through the myplace portal.
Editing a service booking
You can
edit a service booking
on the
myplace portal
before the end date of the service booking. When the service booking is edited, any unspent money allocated for that service will be refunded back to your budget.
You can
end a service booking
by updating the end date. Service bookings should not be deleted.

NDIS participant satisfaction hits 93 per cent

17 November 2018
The latest quarterly data for the National Disability Insurance Scheme released today shows that 93 per cent of participants now rate their experience as 'Very Good' or 'Good' – its highest level since the trial phase.
Some 91 per cent of parents and carers of children under school-age say the NDIS has helped their child better communicate their needs.
And almost one-in-three Australians in the NDIS are receiving disability supports for the first time.
The data comes from the latest COAG NDIS Quarterly Report covering the period 1 July 2018 to 30 September 2018.
"Rolling out the NDIS is a complex and difficult task but these figures show we're making progress
and improving the experience for participants, carers and families," said Minister for Families and Social Services, Paul Fletcher.
"NDIS is now supporting 208,793 Australians which is an increase of 14 per cent on the previous quarter.
"The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) has been working hard to reform the participant pathway and I think that is an important reason we are seeing satisfaction with approved plans increase
by five per cent since the last quarter."
Assistant Minister for Social Services, Housing and Disability Services, Sarah Henderson, said it shows improvements to outcomes as participants spend more time in the Scheme.
"For child participants not yet at school, 91 per cent of parents and carers thought the NDIS has helped increase their child's ability to communicate what they want, compared to 87 per cent in their first year," Ms Henderson said.
"For school-age children 14 and under, 69 per cent of parents and carers felt their child has become more independent in their second year of participation, compared to 54 per cent in their first year.
"Sixty-three per cent of participants aged 15-24 say the NDIS had helped them with daily living activities in their second year of participation, compared to 61 per cent in their first year.
"And three-quarters of participants aged 25 years and over say the NDIS had helped them to exercise more choice and control over their lives during their second year of participation, compared to 71 per cent in their first year."
The report also identifies a significant increase in participants with Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) and Supported Independent Living (SIL) support in their plans, as well as rapid growth in the provider market.
"Currently, 9,536 participants have SDA in their plans, representing an increase of 56 per cent in the year to 30 September 2018," Mr Fletcher said.
"In the year ended 30 September 2018, the number of registered SDA providers more than doubled from 372 to 754, and the number of enrolled SDA dwellings increased by just under 200% from 764 to 2,243.
"The Government and the NDIA will continue to work to provide greater market certainty to providers and potential SDA investors."
The latest report shows the NDIS continues to be delivered within budget, and is projected to remain within budget for the financial year.

The early childhood approach for children younger than 9
Quality support for children
Listen
Print this page
Save page as PDF
If your child has NDIS funding for early childhood intervention, therapy supports or behaviour support, you want to know your provider uses quality practices.
We partnered with the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission to develop a guide to explain what quality practices do and don’t look like, and help you choose the right provider for you and your child.
We detail how a provider must:
put the safety and wellbeing of your child at the centre of what they do
offer quality service that represents best practice
focus on positive outcomes for your child and family
meet your needs and expectations
promote inclusion and social participation
make sure their support improves the quality of life for your child and family.
In the guide, we cover topics with examples in the following areas:
Decision-making: providers must respect your child’s rights to freedom of expression, self-determination and decision-making.
Privacy and dignity: providers must respect your child’s right to privacy and protect their dignity.
Safety checks: providers must offer services to NDIS participants in a safe manner with care and skill.
Competent and professional services: providers must offer supports to NDIS participants in a competent manner with care and skill.
Early childhood supports: providers must offer high-quality and safe supports to NDIS participants.
Specialist behaviour support: providers must offer positive behaviour support appropriate to a child’s needs, use evidence-informed practices, and follow state and territory laws.
Integrity, honesty and transparency: providers must act with honesty and transparency and do the right thing.
We also offer the following:
Questions you can ask when choosing a provider for your child.
Your options if you want to make a complaint.

Who to contact if you have questions, concerns or to make a complaint
Most NDIS providers do their best to provide quality supports and services to people with disability, but issues can occur. You have the right to:
ask questions
seek explanations
make a complaint.
Speaking up can help improve services for your child and other people.
If you have questions or concerns about your child’s current NDIS support, you can talk to any of the following.
Your provider
Sometimes talking to your provider can resolve your questions or concerns.
If you don’t get your desired response or things go wrong, you can also make a complaint directly with them.
It is their responsibility to help you feel safe to ask questions or make a complaint without fear of retribution of loss of services.
The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission (NDIS Commission)
The NDIS Commission is an independent Commonwealth agency established to improve the quality and safety of NDIS supports and services.
They can take complaints or questions from anyone about:
NDIS services or supports not provided in a safe and respectful way
NDIS services and supports not delivered to an appropriate standard
how an NDIS provider has managed a complaint about service provided to an NDIS participant.
You can make a complaint to the NDIS Commission or ask questions by:
completing a
complaint contact form
calling 1800 035 544
For more information, visit the
NDIS Commission website
.
The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA)
AHPRA ensures Australia’s registered health practitioners are suitably trained, qualified and safe to practice.
They can look into safety concerns raised about registered health professionals, students and unregistered people claiming to be health professionals.
You can contact AHPRA by:
calling 1300 419 495
submitting an
online enquiry

AHPRA website
.
Your my NDIS contact
These contact details can be found on your child’s NDIS plan.
An advocate
Advocacy support is for people with disability who face complex challenges.
Family members or carers acting on behalf of people with disability may be able to seek disability advocacy support, as long as there is no conflict of interest.
If you are unable to act, speak or write about a difficult situation on your own, or don’t have a support network to help you, then disability advocacy may be an option.
Find an advocate in your area by:
visiting the
Disability Advocacy Finder
contacting the Disability Gateway on 1800 643 787
searching ‘advocates’ at the
Disability Gateway
.

Provider quarterly report - school leaver employment
The Provider quarterly report - School leaver employment represents data submitted to the NDIA by school leaver employment support providers.
Providers use the school leaver reporting tool to capture and submit data to the NDIA about the participants they are supporting, the time they spend working on milestones toward employment and the outcomes they achieve.

Outcomes by provider
The Agency publishes the final outcomes reported by providers of employment support for school leavers.  The publication of these results highlights the intention of the funding in participant NDIS plans and to enable participants to consider performance when selecting a provider.
Participants can use this information in discussions with providers about what they offer, how they tailor supports to help participants achieve their employment goals and how their results compare to those in the published report.
Lists of “Outcomes by provider” will be released on a 6 monthly basis showing the final outcomes for participants assisted by individual providers over the preceding 12 months.

Crack Down on Fraud

The
Crack Down on Fraud
program supports the work of the
Fraud Fusion Taskforce
and is focussed on strengthening our systems and improving our processes to detect, prevent and respond to fraud.
This will make it easier for participants to use and pay for NDIS supports in the right way, and for providers to claim for NDIS supports they deliver in the right way. Making it easier to get it right, harder to get it wrong.
The Crack Down on Fraud program will improve:
Our systems that assess, process and pay over 400,000 NDIS claims per day.
Systems that check identities to increase participant safety and privacy.
The my NDIS app and NDIS portals.
The program will build:
New ICT systems to connect with other agencies, providers and banks so claims and payments can be done faster with less errors.
A new fraud investigation system that will connect with other enforcement agencies.
Improvements from the Crack Down on Fraud program are being developed in consultation with the disability community and sector.
Crack Down on Fraud improvements delivered
Improvements to how providers prove their identity
Providers can now use myID and Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM) to access NDIS provider portals.
myID is the Australian Government’s Digital ID app.
It is a simple and secure way to prove who you are online.
RAM is an authorisation service that can link to myID.
myID and RAM together help reduce the risk of identity fraud.
Connecting NDIS portals and app with myGov
Participants and nominees can now sign into their NDIS portals and app via the myGov system.
myGov is the go-to place for digital government services and communications.
Connecting to myGov helps us more securely check the identities of people accessing NDIS systems and to protect participant plans and personal data.
More information supporting claims - descriptions
All self-managed participants are now required to provide a description before a claim can be submitted in the NDIS portals and app.
By having more information in a claim, we can check to make sure the payment is for NDIS supports in the participant’s plan. Including descriptions before a claim is submitted means we can process the claim faster and help keep participants and NDIS plans safe from fraud.
New fraud tip-off form
We created a new online
fraud tip-off form
to streamline the reporting of suspected fraud and non-compliance.
The new form helps us to get the information needed so that we can effectively and quickly follow up tip-offs.
Aligning payment timeframes
Payment processing timeframes have been re-aligned with NDIA payment terms of claims being paid within 2 – 3 business days.
This means we have more time to check claims are compliant before they are paid to strengthen compliance within the NDIS.
Improving how we identify accounts accessing our systems
A program has been introduced to check and record account details signing into NDIS portals and apps via myGov. It shows when information is being used to sign in to NDIS portals or app does not match our records for that particpant’s account.
We use this to follow up on participant accounts that are being accessed incorrectly or accounts that are not real - increasing security of participants’ information and privacy and reducing fraudulent activity with participants’ funding.
New data system
We have established a new system to collect and analyse data and information to help find and stop non-compliance and fraud in the NDIS.
Manual reviews for plan manager payments
To reduce non-compliance and fraud, we have stopped automatic payments for claims from almost 1,000 plan managers.
This means we can manually review the claims to make sure they are compliant and in line with participants’ plans before the plan manager is paid.
Removed less secure sign in option
NDIS portal and app users can no longer  use the secret question and answer myGov sign in option to access NDIS portals and app.
This  makes sure more secure myGov sign in options are used to access myGov and linked NDIS systems. This change protects participants’ digital identities and reduces fraudulent activities in the NDIS portals and app.
More information supporting claims – ABNs and evidence
The Agency commonly requests evidence to support claims. Participants who make a claim for self-managed supports in the portals and app will need to provide an Australian Business Number (ABN) and evidence before a claim can be submitted.
This can include invoices, receipts and evidence of payroll expenses for the NDIS support being claimed. If a claim is supported by payroll information, this should not include a tax file number (TFN).
By having more information before a claim is submitted, we can:
Identify and trace NDIS supports.
Process claims faster.
Keep participants and NDIS plans safe from fraudsters.

Improvements to how providers prove their identity
Listen

9 December 2024
We are strengthening how we check the identity of providers.
We will do this by changing the online verification and authorisation systems currently used to verify providers’ identity.
From mid-2025 we are changing how providers prove their identity to use NDIS systems. We are making the changes gradually to allow time for providers to get ready.
Currently, providers and their nominated staff use PRODA to prove who they are when they connect with the NDIA. We will change to using myID with Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM).
myID (formerly myGovID) is the Australian Government’s Digital ID app. It is a simple and secure way to prove who you are online. Once set up, you can use myID to prove your identity across a range of government services.
RAM is an authorisation service that allows you to act on behalf of a provider online when linked with your myID. RAM is used by other government services, such as the Australian Business Register, Hearing Services Online Portal, My Aged Care Service and Support Portal, and the National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) Portal.
myID and RAM together help reduce the risk of identity fraud in the NDIS.
All provider staff members who use NDIS systems will be required to set up their own Digital account with myID. To prepare, you can set up your myID account now and link it to PRODA.
You must have a registered PRODA account, where your ID has been verified with PRODA, to link myID to PRODA.
We will share more information and detailed instructions to help you connect to RAM in the lead up to this transition in 2025.
The NDIS Quality Safeguards Commission (NQSC) will also be moving from PRODA to RAM in the late stage of 2025.
How to set up myID:
Learn
how to set up your Digital ID on the myID website.
To set up myID, you will need:
a smart device
a personal email address
identity documents.
Once you’ve downloaded the app, follow the prompts to set up your myID.
To access NDIS systems, you will need to set up your myID with a ‘standard’ identity strength, at minimum.
If you’re the
principal authority
(a person responsible for the business) you will need to set up your myID
with a strong identity strength
If you are unable to achieve a ‘Strong’ identity strength to link the business, set up your myID to a ‘Standard’ identity strength and contact the
RAM support line
for assistance.
If you are an
authorised user or administrator
, you will need
standard identity strength.
Most provider employees will require standard identity strength.
Your Digital ID belongs to you – don’t share it with others. Sharing your Digital ID could enable others to access your personal data across services such as tax and health. It is your responsibility to protect your Digital ID to make sure your identity and personal information is secure.
If you need help with your myID account, visit the
myID website
If you have any questions about connecting myID to PRODA, please phone 1800 700 199 and select option 1.

Accredited SDA assessors are third party assessors engaged by the SDA developer, owner or provider to certify compliance of a dwelling with the SDA Design Standard. The NDIA does not engage SDA assessors to certify dwellings. Further information on SDA assessors can be found at
SDA Design Standard
.
The accredited SDA assessors listed below certify a dwelling to a particular design category (or categories) in the SDA Design Standard at two stages: design stage certification of an SDA dwelling before construction commences, and final as built certification.
Although accredited SDA assessors are listed below according to a specific State or Territory, accredited SDA assessors are not restricted to these regions and can provide services across all States and Territories.

Neurodegenerative, Palliative Care and Rare Diseases Advisory Group Meeting September 2024

24 September 2024
The Neurodegenerative, Palliative Care and Rare Diseases (NPR) Advisory Group met online on 24 September 2024.
The Chair, Ms Prue Coroneos, General Manager, Policy, Evidence and Practice Leadership, National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), welcomed everyone to the meeting. Ms Coroneos highlighted the importance of this group in supporting the NDIA to hear the voices, perspectives and gain a better understand of the unique challenges people living with neurodegenerative, palliative care needs and rare diseases face.
Focus of the meeting
The meeting covered:
Changes to the NDIS Act.
Planned reforms to NDIS assessment and budgeting processes.
Changes to the NDIS Act
The NDIA provided an overview of recent legislative changes and work the NDIA is undertaking in preparation for the amended NDIS Act to take effect from 3 October 2024. Members were advised there will be further work occurring on the development of associated rules and policies to support the implementation of the changes.
The NDIA confirmed there are no changes to the current access decision process. Members were advised that legislative changes mean that some people will now receive an access decision under different sections of the NDIS Act.
Members sought further clarity from the NDIA on:
Plan roll overs and associated unintended consequences they are seeing.
Communications products the NDIA are developing to explain the changes.
Length of time for change of circumstances applications to be processed.
If the legislative changes will enable a more holistic view of participant’s functions and needs.
How the planning processes will consider fluctuating needs or rapid deterioration.
Assessment and Budgeting
The NDIA provided an overview of ongoing work to design new assessment and budgeting approaches.
The NDIA recognised the value of the advice that the NPR Advisory Group and other advisory groups can provide to help inform future Scheme reforms. The NDIA will also draw on other mechanisms such as dedicated co-design groups and direct engagement with participants, their families and carers. Advice provided through engagement, consultation and co-design will guide the NDIA on what to consider for assessment approaches and tools particularly in considering the needs of participants with complex support needs.
Members will have future opportunities to provide advice on a range of tools, process, participant pathway experience and workforce capability for the NDIA to consider.
Some initial feedback from members included:
The need for inbuild flexibility within the budgeting approach that considers fluctuating needs, degeneration and rapid changes.
Limiting the need for people to retell their story multiple times.
Consider longer term plans.
The need for trauma informed practice.
NPRAG Next Meeting
The NPRAG will meet online again on 26 November 2024.

24 April 2025
We are aware of a fraudulent email imitating an NDIS provider newsletter targeting NDIS participants.
Some participants may have received an email asking them to sign into the NDIS portal to update bank account details.
This email included a link which, if clicked, directs participants to a fake webpage where the user is asked to provide personal login details.
The NDIS will never ask you to click a link to update bank details through email, text message or direct message on social media.
What to do if you clicked the link in scam email
Login to the NDIS participant portal via myGov or the myNDIS mobile app, and change your NDIS login details and myGov login details as soon as possible.
Confirm that your bank details, phone number and email address are correct. If they are incorrect, contact us so we can help you update them.
Contact us
If you have been impacted by a scam and need support, please call the National Contact Centre on 1800 800 110.
How to know, spot and report scams
We want to help participants learn more about scams and fraud, especially how to know it, spot it and report it.
Understanding
what scams are
will support participants to protect their plans.
Be suspicious of unexpected contact or unsolicited requests for your NDIS details.
Please call the NDIS Fraud Reporting and Scams Helpline on 1800 650 717 to report a scam.
We are continuing to work with participants, their nominees and providers to make improvements to how we detect, prevent and respond to fraud in the NDIS.

New FAQs
New FAQ relating to funding periods are located below in the following sections:
Funding amounts, components, periods (s33)
Providers
General
What will change on 3 October?
For existing participants, key changes include:
The introduction of a definition of NDIS supports. These are:
supports that can be funded by the NDIS and stated by the NDIS rules to be NDIS supports.
A replacement rule enabling participants to request a substitute or replacement support that is not an NDIS support (in individual circumstances).
Plans approved after the law comes into effect will have:
total funding amounts
funding component amounts
funding periods.
This clarifies the amount of funds available in the plan and how long the funds need to last.
The NDIA can consider changing a plan management type in specific circumstances;
For example, where someone needs support to manage and spend their plan funds within the funding amount.
Other changes will happen when new NDIS Rules are made. This includes:
the creation of new participant pathways
the new planning framework
support needs assessment
budget model and flexible budgets.
What won't be changing on October 3?
We want to reassure participants that for most, there won’t be major changes to the way they experience the NDIS right now.
What is not changing is the purpose of the NDIS.
The NDIS will continue to provide participants with disability-related supports.
What is the purpose of the new legislation?
The new legislation aims to:
Create the scaffolding needed to progress key NDIS Review recommendations in partnership with people with disability and the disability community.
Clarify the intention of existing legislation
How will the new legislation affect NDIS participants?
Participants may see changes in:
how their eligibility is assessed
the supports that can be funded by the NDIS
how their plans are managed
how their funding is allocated and needs to be spent
requirements for information gathering for eligibility reassessment.
What are NDIS Rules?
The NDIS Rules sit under the NDIS Act and provide details about how the NDIS operates.
States and territories are involved in the approval process for NDIS Rules.
Legislative instruments may be made by the Minister for the NDIS after consulting with affected stakeholders.
Many of the changes to the NDIS will be implemented through new NDIS Rules.
The new NDIS Rules will outline how people can access the NDIS, what assessments are needed, and how budgets will work.
Rules will be developed with people with disability, their families and carers and the disability sector.
What is a transitional rule?
A transitional rule is a rule that the Minister for the NDIS can make within the first 12 months of the legislation being passed, ahead of final rules being agreed with states and territories.
When will the changes take effect?
The new NDIS laws come into effect on 3 October 2024.
Some changes will happen as soon as the laws come into effect. These changes are about returning the NDIS to its original intent.
Other changes will happen later, when new NDIS Rules are made. This includes the creation of new participant pathways and the new planning framework – support needs assessment, budget model and flexible budget.
Will there be consultation on these changes?
The changes were subject to consultation and consideration by the disability community, disability representative and carer organisations, the NDIS Independent Advisory Council, states and territories and the Community Affairs Legislation Committee.
There will continue to be opportunities for consultation to shape how these changes are implemented. Those directly impacted by key decisions about the Scheme will continue to play a key role in developing the detail and in implementing the reforms.
What is the new planning framework?
The new planning framework guides how the NDIS will operate. It explains how people can access the NDIS, how their needs are assessed, and how flexible budgets are created.
Because of changes to the legislation, plans will be built differently in future. This means there will be 2 kinds of NDIS plans.
If your plan was developed through the current planning approach, this will be called an old framework plan.
If your plan is developed using the new assessment model, this will be a new framework plan.
English is not my first language. Will there be translated information about the NDIS legislation?
The NDIA is committed to ensuring all communications on legislative changes are accessible to everyone.
Key information will be translated into 17 languages, including Auslan, to reach as many people as possible.
The NDIA is working with the wider community to test and produce materials in a range of accessible formats including:
Easy Read
Auslan
Braille.
Transition, future changes and co-design
What specific steps is the NDIA taking to ensure a smooth transition?
We are fully committed to ensuring we reach every person – including those who may live in more rural and remote areas or have unique accessibility or language needs.
The NDIA has begun an extensive communications campaign designed to ensure our more than 660,000 participants, as well as their supporters, know what they need to about changes to the NDIS Act.
The NDIA will continue to be clear on what is changing and when, so participants and their supporters can be assured that future changes will be supported with transparency and communication.
How will the NDIA work with the disability community to ensure that the needs and concerns of participants are addressed throughout the implementation of these changes?
It is essential people with disability continue to have a voice in how the detailed design is done and how the changes are implemented.
The NDIA has been delivering reform in partnership with people with disability and the disability community over the past 2 years.
This includes key partnerships with the Disability Representative and Carer Organisations and the Independent Advisory Council.
Throughout July and August this year, the Agency’s Co-design Branch delivered 56 activities, including consultation on the legislative changes to come into effect on 3 October 2024.
We have learnt a lot from these activities and continue to improve the way we work together with the disability community.
In June 2024, the NDIA and disability organisations from across Australia shared a commitment to work together on reforms to the Scheme.
Working in partnership with the disability community remains the cornerstone of implementing change as we move forward.
Changes will be supported with transparency and communication.
What if there is a case for a support to get on the list? What do we do?
A NDIS Evidence Advisory Committee (EAC) will be established to provide independent and transparent advice to Government on what works for participants.
The Committee will provide advice on the evidence base for therapeutic supports accessed through the NDIS, improving outcomes and ensuring better value for participants.
This will ensure the supports funded under the Scheme are beneficial, safe, evidence based and cost effective.
The work of the Committee will be an important input into the development of the final NDIS Support Rule which will be developed with the disability community and States and Territories.
What will be co-designed going forward?
New co-design working groups have started meeting and will be steering a range of co-design and engagement activities including future changes to the NDIS as a result of legislative change.
Key measures such as support needs assessments and budget models will be subject to ongoing co-design.
We will keep looking for new ways for people to have a voice and shape the work we do together.
NDIS supports (s10)
What is and is not a NDIS support?
From October 3 2024, the Government has released the lists of what NDIS participants can and cannot spend their funding on.
The lists include items that are NDIS supports and items that are not NDIS supports.
Participants who need specific items for their disability will still be able to access those items through these lists.
These lists are based on existing guidance, so in most cases there is unlikely to be any change to the supports a person is currently using.
There will be a transition period for the first year of the new NDIS supports lists to give participants time to learn and understand.
If you’re unsure, there are a few things you can do:
read the NDIS Supports list
on the Our Guidelines website.
we'll also be sending a link to all participants
speak to your Local Area Coordinator, Early Childhood Partner or Support Coordinator
if you’re still unsure, call us on 1800 800 110.
How long will I get to change my supports after the legislation change?
From 3 October 2024 you must use your funding to purchase services, items and equipment that can be funded by the NDIS.
We will work with you to help you understand the new rules and access supports that are NDIS supports.
What if I am delivering supports/ accessing supports that are now on the non NDIS support list?
The Government has released definitions of NDIS supports making it clear what NDIS funds can and cannot be used for. These definitions are based on existing guidance.
Lists of specific items that are allowable NDIS supports and those that are not allowed are on the NDIS website.
If a support is included on the list showing what is not an  NDIS Support - it is not allowed to be funded from NDIS plans from 3 October 2024.
There is a transitional rule allowing participants to continue to access supports that are not NDIS supports if they were specifically identified as reasonable and necessary before 3 October 2024, for the duration of their existing plan.
This also includes situations where the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has decided that the support should be funded as a reasonable and necessary support.
This rule does not apply to sexual services, alcohol or drugs. These supports are specified in the primary Act as non-NDIS supports.
NDIS participants will continue to receive the disability-related supports they need. However, the NDIS was not designed to pay for the cost of everyday expenses.
Find more information on the supports lists
.
How can I provide feedback or raise concerns about the changes to my support?
You can contact your local area coordinator, early childhood partner or support coordinator.

.
It is likely that many participants will accidentally or unknowingly use their funding on something not classified as an NDIS support.  What will happen to them, will there be a transition period to help people to adjust to the changes?
We know it will take time for people to learn about and understand the new NDIS support lists and we’ve heard participants’ concerns about what may happen if someone accidentally buys something which is not an NDIS support.
That’s why there will be a transition period for the first year (12 months) to help people to understand the new NDIS Supports lists.
We will work with participants who make mistakes to make sure that they understand the NDIS supports lists.
What if I make a mistake and accidentally purchase a support that’s on the ‘out’ list?
A person who makes a mistake and claims an item which is not an NDIS support will not have a debt raised for first or second mistakes made in claiming where the support is worth less than $1,500.
This means the NDIA must contact participants twice to explain what is and is not an NDIS support before any debt of less than $1,500 is raised against them.
This rule applies to all participants (including participants who self-manage their funding), nominees and child -representative for a 12-month period commencing from 3 October 2024.
For NDIS providers, it applies for 30 days.
This does not apply if a participant purchases illegal items with funding from their plans.
If incorrect claims are repeated or fraudulent, we may take further action.
Firmer actions can include raising a debt or moving the participant onto an Agency-managed plan.
What happens with purchases over $1500?
In the situation where the cost is above $1500 the transitional rule does not apply, and a debt will be raised.
However, it is important to note that any debts related to purchases for $1,500 or more for non-NDIS supports can be written off or waived under the existing provisions of the NDIS Act.
This includes waiver under section 195, which has been updated to allow a debt to be waived in ‘special circumstances’ if the participant unintentionally or unknowingly breaches the Act, regulations, or rules.
It also allows consideration of the participant’s disability as part of a holistic assessment of whether special circumstances exist.
If a debt arises for payments made for non-NDIS supports, it will only be recovered when it is appropriate to do so in line with the Commonwealth policy on debt recovery.
The NDIA will keep using a structured process for debt management, focusing on compliance and audit activities on repeated or intentional non-compliance.
We’ll always consider the individual circumstances, with education and support being the first consideration, particularly during the transition period.
This isn’t about trying to catch people out – we know participants want to do the right thing.
NDIA ‘Safety Net’ for debt
The NDIA has put in place a process that means if the Agency was ever to pursue a debt against a participant (in relation to section 10) – the NDIA CEO would need to sign off this decision first.
This safety net is in place to ensure that raising any debt (in relation to section 10) against a participant would be an absolute last resort and such a decision would never be automated, rather it would not proceed without thoughtful consideration at the most senior level of the Agency.
Purchases or provision of supports prior to 3 October 2024
Please note that the new requirement to spend NDIS amounts only on NDIS supports does not apply to any support with a service or purchase date before 3 October.
If people have made a purchase or booking for an item that is not an NDIS support before this date, they can make a claim for any cancellation fee.
This does not apply if a participant purchases illegal items with funding from their plans.
What if evidence from my treating professional states I need a support on the 'out' list?
If you think an item that isn’t a NDIS support is better for you, you can ask to substitute that support.
Only some supports can be replaced.
You can only spend your funding on a substitution if we have agreed in writing that you can buy this support.
There are a few criteria that must be met before we can approve this.
The Rules say which types of supports can be replaced.
The substituted support must also:
replace one or more supports that are NDIS supports
be the same price or cheaper than the NDIS support it is replacing, and
be likely to provide the same or better outcomes than the NDIS supports it is replacing.
You can
view the NDIS supports
on Our Guidelines website.
What is a replacement support?
In some specific circumstances, we can fund supports that are not NDIS supports.
We call these replacement supports.
When we say replacement support, we mean the service, item or equipment you would like to use instead of the NDIS support or supports in your plan.
Only some supports can be replaced and only if we agree in writing can you buy this support.
A replacement support isn’t an extra support. It replaces an existing NDIS support or supports in your plan.
To find out what can be considered as a replacement support, see
What does NDIS fund?
When would a replacement support be requested?
We know that every participant has their own unique needs, and in specific circumstances a participant might need to use their funding for a support that is not a NDIS support.
Participants can ask for a NDIS support to be replaced with certain non-NDIS supports. These are called replacement supports.
This will enable participants to request a replacement of their existing support with a support that is not a NDIS support.
This may occur in circumstances where a standard item might provide better outcomes and cost the same or less than a NDIS Support.
A replacement support may include household items, or very specific items that support a participant’s unique accessibility or communication needs.
Replacement supports must be from this pre-approved replacement supports list.
Applications can be made for the items specified below:
Standard commercially available household items
Smart watches
Tablets
smart phones
apps for accessibility/communication purposes
For more information about replacement supports including how to apply for them,
see What does NDIS fund?
What’s the process for a replacement support?
To get a replacement support approved, the Agency needs to be satisfied the replacement support will provide the same or better outcomes and cost the same or less than another NDIS support that is already in the participant’s plan.
Participants must apply for and receive approval of a replacement support before purchasing the support.
It cannot be done after purchasing a non-NDIS support.
Participants can fill out an application for a replacement support on the NDIS website or provide the same information in an email or over the phone.
If your application for a replacement support for an item is not approved, you can’t apply for that same replacement support again for 12 months.
Replacement support example
The NDIS is not designed to fund items such as an iPad or Apple watch.
However, should a participant know that they are able to communicate with their loved ones or a worker by using an iPad – rather than a specialist and more costly piece of equipment – then they can request the Agency to fund this.
The NDIA will then consider this request and may well say ‘Yes, absolutely that makes sense – so we will fund that on this occasion’.
That’s a really clear example of replacing a more expensive item with a better, more cost-effective solution.
This just makes sense.
It’s important to note the list of replacement supports won’t apply for every participant.
The funding of a replacement support will only benefit some participants, who due to their unique circumstances, are clearly able to demonstrate that a specific item or support, will benefit them and provide a better, more cost-effective option.
Is there someone I can ask at the NDIA to check that I am doing the right thing?
You can contact your local area coordinator, early childhood partner or support coordinator to help you understand what supports you can buy.
You can also

.
How will the NDIA ensure this process is easy and accessible?
We are committed to ensuring that all communications about the Government changes are accessible to everyone.
That's why we are working with the sector and our suppliers to test and produce materials in a range of accessible formats, including Easy Read documents, animations/videos and Auslan.
An important part of our website accessibility is that content can be easily accessed, including for those using screen readers.
We are working with the sector to develop and test messaging and agile approaches to producing accessible content.
Key information will be translated into 17 languages, including Auslan, to reach as many people as possible.
Why is the change to Section 10 of the NDIS Act 2013 necessary?
We have heard consistently, particularly from participants self-managing their supports, that it is not clear what they can spend their funding on.
Making it clear what the NDIS does, and does not, fund will help participants make more informed choices about what they can use their funds for.
The proposed amendments to Section 10 of the NDIS Act enable the creation of new rules (Category A) that outline what is and is not an NDIS support.
It's going to take some time to make a Category A rule. We'll work closely with the disability community and state and territory governments to understand what should and shouldn’t be included.
In the interim, the Minister may create a transitional NDIS Supports rule. This will be in place as soon as the instrument is created and will have effect until the new Category A NDIS supports rule is agreed.
Is Short Term Accommodation (STA) an NDIS support?
Yes, short term accommodation (STA) is included in the 'supports that are NDIS supports' list.
How does STA work?
STA is designed to help informal supports continue their caring role. It is one option that provides participants and their informal supports time apart.
STA allows participants to stay away from their homes and informal supports for a short time. It can be funded for up to 14 days at a time to a maximum of 28 days per calendar year.
STA funding can be used for assistance with self-care or community access and short-term accommodation. It cannot be used to pay for day-to-day living costs such as food and groceries, lifestyle costs or travel.
STA cannot be used to pay for items on the list of non-NDIS supports.
Providers offering STA in a centre or group residence may include meals and activities within the daily rate charged – in line with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits – however these cannot be included if the participant choses to use STA in an individual setting.
We know there are still some questions about what can be claimed under STA, particularly if you want to use a hotel or other accommodation options. A new operational guideline about STA will be available in early 2025 with more information.
We will keep you updated on any changes, and further information will be shared when it is available.
How is STA funded?
STA is funded in a participant's core budget if it relates to their disability support needs, and where it is reasonable and necessary.
It does not need to be stated in a participant's plan.
Participants can access STA as part of the 'assistance with daily life tasks in a group or shared living arrangement' category on the NDIS supports list.
The NDIS funds standard rates for STA, which are available in the
NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits
.
Generally funding for STA is for a group price, unless there is evidence that a participant needs individual support.
STA cannot be used to pay for items on the list of non-NDIS supports.
Does STA cover the cost of transport?
Participants cannot use STA funding to pay for transport to the accommodation funded through STA.
If a participant wants to access STA supports far away from their usual home, the cost of the travel is a day-to-day living cost they are expected to pay for separately. Participants should consider this when choosing an STA option that is right for them. Some participants may have funding for transport to an activity or other support already in their plan. If a participant usually needs transport support because of their disability, their provider may include the cost of transport from the accommodation to activities they provide.
Can STA be used for holidays?
No. STA is not for holidays or tourist travel. It is designed to provide participants and their informal supports time apart.
STA cannot be used to pay for items on the list of non-NDIS supports.
NDIS funding can’t be used to pay for:
cruises, holiday packages, holiday accommodation and airfares, passports, visas, or travel and vehicle insurance
accommodation or travel expenses for family members or support workers
theme parks, music, theatre, cinema, sporting events, and conferences
day-to-day living costs such as food or meals. In some cases, your provider may include meals as part of your STA in a centre or group setting. The NDIS funds standard rates for STA, so you may need to negotiate these costs with your provider. Once you have used your STA funding, you can’t ask us for more. You can find the rates in the
NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits
.
If a participant requires support while on holiday, they can continue to use their usual non-STA supports from their NDIS plan.
Participants should speak with their support coordinator, local area coordinator, early childhood partner or planner if they are going on a holiday and need their NDIS supports delivered in another location.
Is STA available for participants in Supported Independent Living or living alone?
No. This is because if a participant is living alone or in a supported independent living arrangement, they already have time apart from family and informal supports.
What are the impacts on individualised living options (ILO) in relation to rent and rental subsidies?
An ILO arrangement should be delivered in line with the
ILO guideline
. ILO is a package of supports to help a participant live in their chosen home environment in a way that best suits them. It does not fund the home itself.
An ILO includes an agreed ILO service proposal and is overseen by a provider. An ILO does not include a participant’s rent or mortgage payments, or everyday costs like food, electricity or internet bills.
If participants are living with people who offer them support throughout their day or week, and who have ILO funding in their plan and an ILO arrangement in place, the changes to Section 10 in the Amended NDIS Act (NDIS supports) will not impact payments for these supports. The supports provided must be in line with the participant’s ILO service proposal and the ILO Operational Guidelines and
Section 10 requirements for NDIS supports
.
The new NDIS transitional rules covering these supports align with existing ILO policy. They aim to ensure participants are not using their NDIS funding to pay for their rental costs and are using their NDIS funding to purchase NDIS supports under an agreed ILO arrangement.
Participants, their families and supporters interested in considering ILO arrangements should contact the NDIS or a local area coordinator for more information.
A new policy on ILO will be developed through co-design and released mid 2025.
Is animal therapy an NDIS support?
Animal-assisted therapy can be an NDIS support - therapeutic support
Animal-assisted therapy is not the same as ‘animal therapy’. Animal-assisted therapists may use an animal to play a role in a goal-directed, structured intervention which will assist the therapist and the participant to engage in therapy.
Animals can be used as therapy tools, just like a board game, Lego, or a swing could also be used as a tool in a therapy session.
For example, a psychologist or counsellor may use an animal in therapy sessions to assist a participant to calm, focus or regulate whilst the counselling/psychology session is undertaken.
An occupational therapist may use an animal in therapy sessions to assist a participant to participate in an activity such as walking, standing, balancing etc. In these interventions, the animal may be used by the therapist to help the client meet specific goals but the therapy is delivered to the participant by the allied health professional, with the animal used to support participation.
Animal therapy is not an NDIS support.
Activities which are provided for people to have a positive experience with an animal such as engaging with puppies or riding a horse might be called ‘animal therapy’ by the provider of the service.
Recreational, sporting or social activities involving animals could also be called animal therapy.
These activities are not animal-assisted therapeutic interventions and are not NDIS Supports, even if the provider of the service is an allied health professional.
What about supports to participate in social and recreational opportunities that include animals?
The NDIA and NDIS acknowledges that NDIS participants may engage in programs that include animals to provide sporting, social and recreational opportunities for people with disabilities, and capacity building support.
This may include for example, participation in horse riding.
If NDIS participants need extra help to participate in horse riding activities because of their disability, the extra help can be funded in their plan.
This extra help could be a support worker or assistive products that help the participant engage in the activity when it is happening.
Participants might also use their therapy supports budget to work with a therapist to build their skills to do the sporting, social or recreational activity more independently in the future.
NDIS participants will still need to pay for the general costs of their sporting, social or recreational activities as these are costs that everyone must pay for these kinds of activities.
For example, everyone who wants an activity delivered to them has to pay for that activity themselves whether or not they have a disability.
This is the same whether the activity includes an animal or not. Participants cannot use their NDIS funding to pay for the costs of other sporting, recreational or social activities like surfing lessons, basketball, art classes or gaming.
The bans on therapy supports like 'gaming therapy' or 'yoga therapy', does that include social group programs which include these strategies?
Noting also that most therapists utilise some type of games in therapy sessions as standard practice, as part of building various skills.
Supports that provide evidence-based therapy to help participants improve or maintain their functional capacity in areas such as language and communication, personal care, mobility and movement, interpersonal interactions, functioning (including psychosocial functioning) and community living are included as NDIS supports. Evidence based therapeutic supports can only be delivered by an allied health professional.
Evidence based therapists may use a variety of tools to play a role in a goal-directed, structured intervention which will assist the therapist and the participant to engage in therapy. This may include board games, online games, Lego or an animal. The therapy is delivered to the participant by the allied health professional and the tool is used to support participation.
What about if my activity is delivered through a disability-specific group or centre-based program?
If your activity is being delivered through a group and centre-based program and the costs of the activity and the support you need are fully covered by the hourly rate charged by the provider in line with the NDIS Pricing Arrangements, you can purchase your group and centre-based program using your NDIS funds.
If your group and centre-based program does not cover the costs of an activity within the hourly rate they charge to support you in that activity then you will need to pay for the cost of the activity yourself.
For example, if your group and centre-based program goes bowling and the cost of bowling is not covered by the approved hourly rate then you need to pay for these costs yourself.
Is Lego therapy included on the out list? Do delegates have clarity about therapy supports and which supports are allowed?
Supports that provide evidence-based therapy, to help participants improve or maintain their functional capacity in areas such as language and communication, personal care, mobility and movement, interpersonal interactions, functioning (including psychosocial functioning) and community living are included as NDIS supports. Evidence-based therapeutic supports can only be delivered by an allied health professional or appropriately qualified professional.
Evidence based therapists may use a variety of tools to play a role in a goal-directed, structured intervention which will assist the therapist and the participant to engage in therapy. This may include board games, online games, Lego or an animal. The therapy is delivered to the participant by the allied health professional and the tool is used to support participation.
Activities that are delivered without a best quality evidence-base and/or by people who are not appropriately qualified to develop and deliver therapy are not funded as therapeutic supports.
You can find more information about alternative and complementary therapies that are not evidence-based at
What does NDIS fund?
Training on all legislative changes is being delivered to all delegates. Guidance for delegates has also been updated across NDIA systems.
Can NDIS  funding be used to purchase pet insurance for assistance animals?
NDIS funding can be used to buy an assistance animal and pay for most of its associated costs when approved by the NDIA.
However, funding cannot be used to pay for pet insurance for an assistance animal. More information about assistance animals is available in
Our Guideline – Assistance animals
.
NDIS funding can’t be used to buy pets or companion animals, or to pay for any pet or companion animal related costs including:
Pet food, toys or accessories
Veterinarian costs
Pet boarding
Pet grooming
Pet insurance
Taxidermy and pet cremations, burials or funerals.
Is specialised driver training an NDIS support?
The NDIS supports list describes that driver training with a specialised vehicle driving instructor can be funded for eligible participants.
A specialised vehicle driving instructor is someone who has experience and training in providing driving instruction to people with disability and is registered or licensed to be a driving instructor in the relevant State or Territory.
The information available in current operational guidance remains applicable.
Our Guideline – Vehicle modifications
and driving supports describes the range of driver supports that may be funded:
A driver trained occupational therapist assessment and a driving instructor for the on-road part of the assessment, if a participant plans to drive the vehicle.
Specialised driving lessons - additional driving lessons where a participant’s disability impacts their ability to learn to drive.
Are disability specific bicycles, including electric bicycles, considered an NDIS support?
Yes. Bicycles or tricycles, with or without an electric motor, that include disability specific features, or have been designed to meet the disability specific needs of a participant, are an NDIS support.
This is because they are considered an assistive product for recreation and can be funded if they also meet the ‘reasonable and necessary’ criteria applied to all NDIS supports.
The costs associated with adapting or modifying a standard bicycle or tricycle to meet a participant’s disability specific needs may also be an NDIS support. However, in these circumstances the participant, or their family, would need to self-fund the cost of the bicycle or tricycle that is being adapted or modified.
Standard, non-modified, bicycles or tricycles including electric bicycles are not NDIS supports.
In some specific circumstances, the NDIS may fund supports that are not listed as NDIS supports. These are called replacement supports. Electric bicycles are not considered standard commercially available household items and therefore are not a support for which a replacement can be requested.
Are sexual services an NDIS support?
Under the laws of the NDIS sexual services can’t be funded.
Sexual services is not defined in the legislation but is given its ordinary meaning by the NDIA.
Sexual services are taken to include any sexual conduct undertaken with a participant for payment or reward, including direct physical activity between a participant and another person for the purpose of sexual gratification.
This includes all services that may be provided by a sex worker.
The NDIS will continue to provide reasonable and necessary funding to participants to access the disability related supports and services they need.
This includes other sexuality related supports due to a participant’s disability, for example adaptive equipment, sex counselling and individualised sexual education supports where reasonable and necessary.
How does the allowable NDIS supports list work?
The list of allowable NDIS supports is not exhaustive, meaning it does not exclude items that are not specifically listed.
The purpose of the list is to clarify the types of supports that fall under the overarching description.
It is important for participants to know that for something to be considered an NDIS support, it must fit within the overarching description provided in schedule 1 (however it does not have to be specifically listed) and of course, must not be included in the non-allowable NDIS supports list.
The NDIS support list includes high intensity daily personal activities, and states that supports must be provided by a worker with additional qualifications and experience.
The NDIS support list includes high intensity daily personal activities, and states that supports must be provided by a worker with additional qualifications and experience. What does this mean?
You should ensure that the people providing your high intensity daily personal activity supports have relevant qualifications and/or training to deliver the support to you safely and appropriately.
The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission provides guidance which describes the skills and knowledge that NDIS providers and workers should ensure they have when supporting participants receiving high intensity daily personal activities.
You can find more information about this guidance on the
NDIS Commission website
.
Are modified fluids and thickeners NDIS supports?
Modified fluids and thickeners are NDIS supports. They are what we call
disability-related health supports
.
These include:
low-cost assistive technology – equipment, technology, or devices to assist with feeding and swallowing needs
modified foods including liquid thickener products
help to prepare specific foods which you can safely eat
a support worker to help you eat or drink safely if you can’t do this yourself because of your disability.
Are dietetics/dietitians NDIS supports?
As an evidence-based therapy, dietetics is covered under ‘
Therapeutic supports
’.
The list of supports detailed under each category in the list of Supports that are NDIS supports is not exhaustive.
The NDIS will fund dietetics where the participant needs this therapeutic support due to their disability and it meets the reasonable and necessary test.
The NDIS Pricing Arrangements 2024-25 (PAPL) includes dietetics under the ‘Capacity Building – Improved Health and Wellbeing’ category (pg. 81-82).
The PAPL is currently being reviewed and will be updated to be consistent with current practice.
Would food processors and aerators be considered exemptions to the supports that are not NDIS supports list?
Based on the NDIS Transitional Rules 2024, food processers, including the purchase of prepared aerated drink/beverage or household item to aerate water, such as a soda stream, are not NDIS supports.
These are classed as a day-to-day living costs.
What are dysphagia supports?
Dysphagia supports are what we call disability-related health supports. Generally, if a participant has dysphagia which is ongoing and directly related to their disability, we can fund dysphagia supports for them. We will need evidence to support this, such as reports or assessments from a speech pathologist.
Dysphagia supports we may fund include:
low-cost assistive technology – this means equipment, technology, or devices to help you eat and drink
modified foods including liquid thickener products
help to prepare specific foods which you can safely eat
a support worker to help you eat or drink safely if you can’t do this yourself because of your disability.
To help you manage dysphagia, we may also fund a speech pathologist to:
make a mealtime management plan, sometimes called an oral eating and drinking care plan, which describes how you can eat and drink safely
train your support workers, family or carers in your specific disability-related dysphagia support needs.
Based on the NDIS support transitional rules, either the purchase of prepared aerated drink/beverage or household item to aerate water, such as a soda stream, would not be an NDIS Support as it would be classed as a day-to-day living cost.
If the participant needs further information, they can contact their My NDIS Contact or Support Coordinator.
Can the NDIS fund meal preparation or delivery services?
Yes, the NDIS can fund the cost of meal preparation and delivery, but not the cost of food or ingredients. If your disability makes it difficult to prepare meals, you can use your funding for supports like a support worker or meal delivery services.
Meal preparation and delivery services must provide itemised invoices separating the cost of food from preparation and delivery costs. Services like Uber Eats or fast-food platforms typically don’t meet these requirements as they do not provide the necessary separation.
For detailed guidance, you can refer to
Our Guideline – Nutrition Supports including meal preparation
.
What if my support worker is unavailable or I live in a rural area?
If your plan includes funding for a support worker to help with meal preparation, and the support worker is temporarily unavailable, you can use this funding flexibly for meal delivery for a short period.
This arrangement should be temporary, and you may need to provide evidence if it extends for a longer time. In rural areas, meal delivery providers must also provide itemised invoices to meet NDIS requirements.
Does the NDIS fund groceries, fast food, or dietary supplements?
No, the NDIS does not fund groceries, fast food, or takeaway services, as these are considered everyday living costs for everyone. Dietary supplements are also generally not funded unless they are prescribed or recommended as part of managing a disability-related need.
For example, if a healthcare professional determines that your disability requires specific supplements, these may be considered under certain circumstances, provided they meet the NDIS funding criteria.
How are decisions about meal preparation supports made, and what evidence is needed?
Decisions about funding for meal preparation supports are based on your individual plan and the NDIS funding criteria. If included in your plan, this may be as a stated or non-stated support.
Providers must issue itemised invoices for meal preparation and delivery claims. While a quote is not usually required, if additional funding is sought or the arrangement extends beyond a short-term period, evidence such as a recommendation or plan change request may be needed.
Are household items recommended by a qualified speech pathologist or APD on the Replacement supports list?
Standard commercially available household items are included on the Replacement support lists. Household items that are required, recommended by a qualified speech pathologist or dietician, such as a blender to prepare a participant’s special diet would be considered a replacement item.
If a participant wishes to have these supports included in their plan they would need to apply using the
Replacement support
application process.
Are parenting programs funded by the NDIS?
The NDIS funds reasonable and necessary supports to help children with disability or significant developmental delay work towards their goals.
We can only fund supports that are included in the list of Supports that are NDIS supports. We can’t fund things are that are not an NDIS support.
The new rules clarify that the NDIS does not fund general parenting programs.
By general parenting programs, we mean programs available to all parents that help build parenting skills. This approach aligns with the guidance in place before the new legislation took effect on 3 October 2024.
What early intervention or developmental delay supports are available to children and their parents?
Early intervention supports for children with disability or developmental delay focus on helping children, families, and carers work towards specific goals that are identified in their NDIS plan.
Early intervention supports also build the family’s capacity alongside the child's. Parents and carers may participate in one-on-one, or group sessions with other parents and carers who have similar goals within their child’s NDIS plan.
These programs are designed to build their capacity to maximise their child’s independence and development, by building the capacity and skills of the child’s family and carers.
Parenting support can also be provided to people with disability who are parents through their NDIS plan. Where an NDIS participant who is a parent has arrangements in their NDIS plan to support them in their parenting role because of their disability, those arrangements do not change.
Our
Early Childhood Approach
and
Early Connections
OGs outline how we help children with disability to get the support they need.  We will continue to update our guidelines as we implement legislative changes.
Is the art and music therapy independent review complete?
The independent review for art and music therapy is now complete.
We have received the final report from Dr Stephen Duckett AM.
We will consider his recommendations in the development of our operational guidance and
NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits
(PAPL).
The updated operational guidance will be published in the coming months. Dr Duckett’s report will be also published in full on our website, including key information in Easy Read and Auslan.
Until the new guidance is released later this year, there are no changes to the status of music and art therapy as NDIS supports.
For more information refer to:

Funding amounts, components, periods (s33) (new)
What are funding periods?
A funding period is the time that part of a participant’s funding becomes available, and how long it needs to last. Participants can spend up to the amount of funding available in that time. Funding periods can apply to either the total amount of funding in participant’s plan, or funding component amounts.
What is total funding amount?
Plans now include a total funding amount. This shows the total amount of funds allocated to all reasonable and necessary supports over the length of a participant’s plan.
The funding is divided into funding components, like Core, Capacity building, or Capital. The total amount for each funding component will be made available to you in specific time intervals called funding periods. Each funding component has its own funding periods.
What are funding components?
Funding components group together related types of supports in a participant's plan. Each component has an allocated amount that can be used to purchase supports covered under that component.
For example, the Core funding component might include support for daily activities, while Capacity Building could cover therapies or training.
When are different funding periods being introduced and who will be affected?
Different funding periods are being introduced from 19 May 2025 to:
help make sure supports are available when participants need them
reduce the risk of running out of funds early.
This change will be rolled out gradually. Participants will not be impacted until they receive a new or reassessed plan following discussion with them to understand their circumstances.
Funding periods will usually be set at 3-months on the basis this gives participants flexibility but also helps them manage their budget so their funding lasts the full length of their plan.
Funding periods won’t change the total funding amount, they only change when participants can access their funds.
Why have different funding periods been introduced?
Different funding periods have been introduced to help participants manage their NDIS funding by providing access to regular, manageable amounts over time, rather than all at once.
Funding periods will usually be set at 3-months on the basis this gives flexibility to participants but also helps participants manage budgets.
This won’t happen until participants get a new or reassessed plan following discussion with them to understand their circumstances.
Will the total amount of funding in a participant’s plan change?
No, funding periods don't affect a participant's total budget, only when funding will be made available across the duration of their plan
Can unused funding be rolled over to the next funding period?
At the end of each funding period, any unspent funds will rollover into the next funding period in the same plan. This means the unused funding will be added to the new funding period. However, funds will only rollover during the same plan.
This approach ensures that support is available as needed over time.
Can funding from a future funding period be brought forward?
Funding from a future funding period generally can't be brought forward.
In exceptional circumstances, the NDIA may bring forward a future funding period if there is an urgent need. This won't change the total amount of funding in the plan, so careful budgeting is still needed to ensure there's enough funding to meet support needs later in the plan.
If a participant's situation has changed and they need more or different supports, they can contact the NDIA to request a change to their plan.
It's important for participants to ask for help early, before funds run out.
Why are funding periods generally 3-months?
Funding periods are more effective when set at a duration that is not over an extended period.
Funding periods will usually be set at 3-months on the basis this gives flexibility to participants but isn't so big as not to be in line with budgets and/or funds provided to people in other aspects of life.
Staged funding is a common approach across Australian Government programs. It means funding is provided in parts over time, rather than all at once.
This helps people manage their budgets and supports consistent use of funding over the length of the plan.
Other government payments like the age pension also use set funding periods.
How is the length of a participant’s funding periods decided? (new)
Funding periods can vary in length. They may be one, 3, 6, or 12 months, depending on the participant’s needs.
In most cases, the NDIS will begin with 3-month funding periods when discussing a participant’s plan.
The length of funding periods is based on the participant’s individual circumstances, including:
their preferences
their support needs
any identified risks
the total funding in their plan
the types and costs of supports
how they have used funding in previous plans
Some supports may require shorter funding periods, such as one month. Others, particularly those involving more complex needs, may require longer periods.
Can funding periods be different lengths in a participant’s plan? (new)
Yes, funding periods can vary in length within a participant’s plan. For example, a participant’s plan might have funding periods of one, 3, 6, or 12 months.
A participant may also have one funding component amount with 3-month funding periods and another component amount with shorter, one-month funding periods.
Most plans will have more than one funding period. If a participant’s plan lasts longer than 12 months, they will always have more than one funding period.
Each funding period will start immediately after the previous one, ensuring the participant won’t be left without funding.
The participant’s plan will show whether funding periods apply to the whole plan or to specific funding component amounts. It will also list the dates each funding period starts and ends as well as how much funding can be used during each period.
For plans that already have a 12-month funding period and are continued without reassessment, the 12-month funding period will remain the same. Participants can continue using their funding as they currently do. Funding periods generally won’t change until the plan is reassessed.
When will a participant receive their funding? (new)
Funding is usually spread evenly across a participant’s plan to help manage supports throughout the length of their plan. For example, if a participant has a 12-month plan with 3-month funding periods, they’ll typically get 25% of their funding at the start of each period.
Some supports may be funded differently:
daily supports (like in-home care) consider the number of days in each period, including weekends and holidays.
one-off or setup supports (like assistive technology, home/vehicle modifications, or medium-term accommodation) may be fully funded at the start or when needed. Unused funds can roll over to the next period.
enteral feeding products are funded for 12 months at the start of each year.
Participants might also get more funding upfront for:
behaviour support planning
changing needs or situations (e.g. hospital discharge)
intensive capacity building
bulk buying consumables (e.g. continence products).
How are funding periods managed? (new)
Funding periods are managed based on the participant’s chosen plan management option, offering flexibility to suit individual needs:
Self-managed – the participant manages their funding and spends it according to their plan and within their funding periods.
Plan managed – a registered plan manager manages the participant’s funding and helps ensure it is used correctly within the funding periods.
Agency-managed – the NDIA manages the participant's funding, ensuring it is spent in line with their plan and within their funding periods.
Where possible, this approach ensures that participants can choose the plan management type that works best for them, while also ensuring funding is used effectively across the funding periods.
How can providers help participants manage their budgets?
Support coordinators should work with participants at the start of their plan to establish a schedule of support that can be delivered within the funding allocated to each period. This ensures that supports can be provided consistently throughout the funding period.
Plan Managers will support participants to spend in accordance with their plan including within funding periods.
Providers must only deliver supports that are within the available funding for each period, and claims should be submitted promptly after services are delivered.
How will participants and providers see funding periods?
Participants will be able to see their funding periods in the participant portal, the NDIS app, and their plan document. They will have access to information about how much funding is available, how much has been used, and when the next amount will be available.
With the participant’s consent, Plan Managers and Support Coordinators will also be able to view this information in the provider portal.
Can a provider claim across 2 funding periods?
Yes, a provider can claim for services delivered in a previous funding period, as long as the dates of the invoice fall within the plan. The current funding period must have sufficient remaining or unspent funds rolled over from the previous period to cover the claim.
What types of supports may have different funding periods?
Some supports may have different funding periods based on how they are delivered. For example, high-cost regular supports like Supported Independent Living (SIL) may have monthly funding periods to align with service delivery. In some cases, participants may need more funding upfront, for example, to purchase assistive technology like a custom wheelchair. In these cases, more funding will be available at the start of the plan.
Where can participants and providers see details of funding periods?
Funding periods will be visible in:
the participant portal
the my NDIS app
the plan document.
Participants will be able to see:
how much funding is available in each period
how much has been used
how much funding has been released in the plan so far
when the next amount will become available.
Plan managers and support coordinators (with the participant’s consent), can see funding period information in the NDIS provider portal.
Can participants request a review of a decision about the funding periods and total budget amounts in their plan?
If a participant is not happy with the funding periods and total budget amounts in their plan, they can request an internal review of their plan.
Why is capacity building not flexible with core?
The way plans are built and funding allocated across core, capacity building and capital budgets is not changing until the new planning framework commences. This includes no changes to flexibility within and across these budgets.
How will people who are Agency-managed have the same level of support and choice?
There are no changes regarding access to registered or unregistered providers as a result of the legislation changes.
We will help participants and nominees understand these changes and implement their plans. Participants can continue to access plan implementation support from their My NDIS Contact or, support coordinator, plan manager or other services such as recovery coaches if they are funded in their plan. Plan managers and support coordinators are expected to provide assistance to the participant to understand their funding options and choices.
If the participant needs additional assistance because of their supported decision making needs, they can ask for capacity building funding in their plan.
If participants want to access more flexibility with the ability to choose unregistered providers, they can have a discussion about their plan management type with their planner or local area coordinator.
Each plan can continue to have a mix of plan management types based on an individual participant’s needs and preferences.
Training for NDIA staff on supported decision making has been designed and will begin to be delivered from November 2024. This will assist planners to prioritise supported decision making when having discussions with participants.
Can a participant negotiate to 'unstate' a support during planning?
The purpose of stating supports in a participant’s plan is to ensure specific disability needs are addressed.
It is therefore not something that would generally be changed in the planning process.
Is there going to be enough flexibility in these arrangements to enable plans to work for people with volatile needs?
The way plans are built and funding allocated across core, capacity building and capital budgets is not changing until the new planning framework commences. This includes no changes to flexibility within and across these budgets.
Participants will continue to be able to make change requests when their circumstances change. This includes requesting a variation for crisis or emergency funding as a result of a significant change to the participant's support needs.
As well as there being s10 rules around allowable supports in place, will there be any restrictions on choice of registered providers for home and living supports?
The NDIS Provider and Worker Registration Taskforce recently provided advice to the Government on the design and implementation of a new regulatory model.
The Taskforce made 11 recommendations and 10 implementation actions covering provider and worker registration, some of which required an immediate response and others that will be designed with close consultation with the disability community. The Taskforce conducted thorough consultation, and this important process will continue.
The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission will progress Rule changes to mandate registration for support coordination, platform providers and SIL. Consultation on these changes will commence shortly. The new Rules will allow for a period of transition to the new mandatory registration arrangements.
Currently, if a participant’s plan is Agency-managed, there are some constraints in place, including that they must purchase from registered NDIS providers only.
Under the SDA Rules, SDA providers must also be registered.
Why do supports need to be listed in separate components?
A funding component amount in a plan might include funding for more than one support category. This means a participant can choose how to spend their funding across all the supports under that funding component amount.
For example, in the same funding component amount we can include any funding for:
transport
consumables
assistance with daily life
assistance with social, economic and community participation.
Eligibility reassessments (s30)
Why are new letters being sent to participants about the eligibility reassessment process?
We have made some immediate changes to improve the process for eligibility reassessment for participants, families and their carers.
We understand eligibility reassessments can feel overwhelming, and we want you to know what information is required to support your eligibility reassessment.
We have now introduced new eligibility reassessment letters which outline more detail about the types of information you may wish to provide.
This also gives you the opportunity to provide us with information we can’t reasonably get in a different way.
The new letters:
tell you an eligibility reassessment has started, and why
are clearer about the information you may wish to provide
tell you that you have 90 days to supply this information.
The new letters are the second step in our plans to address feedback from the disability community.
We will continue to streamline and simplify the eligibility reassessment process to ensure you can easily understand and navigate it.
If you need more time, you can call us on 1800 800 100 or
contact us
or your my NDIS contact for help.
What are the new timeframes to provide additional information and when does this change commence?
We have extended the timeframe for participants to provide additional information to support eligibility reassessments from 28 to 90 days.
This came into effect on 30 January 2025.
Participants who are notified about an eligibility reassessment will now be given 90 days to provide information to help us understand if their support needs have changed and whether they still meet the eligibility criteria for the Scheme.
We understand these requests can feel overwhelming and takes time to get information.
Participants will now have more time to get information to us.
Will the timeframe extension apply if I am currently undergoing an eligibility reassessment on 30 January 2025?
Yes, participants who have already received a request to provide information due to their eligibility being reassessed and need more time, can
contact us
or their my NDIS Contact for help.
What is the purpose of an eligibility reassessment?
Eligibility reassessments help us understand if a participant’s support needs have changed and whether they still meet the eligibility criteria for the Scheme, particularly if they have received early intervention support through the NDIS Early Intervention pathway.
The NDIS Early Intervention pathway is mainly accessed by children in recognition that when we support children early, it can improve outcomes and reduce their need for supports later in life.
While eligibility reassessments have always been a part of the NDIS, we acknowledge the experience may be new for some participants.
We understand these requests can feel overwhelming and takes time to get information.
Participants will now have more time to get information to us.
How does the eligibility reassessment process work?
We send a letter to a participant (or nominee) to let them know about the eligibility reassessment and that they can provide additional information.
We understand that it can take time to get this information. That’s why we have extended the timeframe for participants to provide additional documentation to support eligibility reassessments from 28 to 90 days. If the information isn’t available in 90 days, the participant (or nominee) can ask for more time.
If we decide someone isn’t eligible or they don’t respond to our request within the timeframe, we may cease their access to the NDIS. But we will make multiple efforts to contact you so we can talk to you about support needs.
Why is this changing?
We understand these requests can feel overwhelming and it takes time to get information.
Participants will now have more time to get information to us. We recognise there is work to be done with participants and the disability sector to improve the eligibility reassessment process.
We are working to strengthen our approach through:
better communication with participants and families about what is involved during an eligibility reassessment
providing more time for people to supply the agency with relevant information about their evidence of eligibility and whether it has changed
improving the communication and resources participants receive when they undergo the reassessment process.
Foundational Supports
Do the legislative amendments address foundational supports?
The amendments don't directly address foundational supports, the focus is on strengthening the overall framework of the NDIS.
This includes ensuring that necessary supports are available to participants, which may involve foundational supports being addressed indirectly as part of the broader reforms and improvements to the Scheme.
Access (s21)
What are the changes to access?
New participants will be informed if they meet access to the NDIS by meeting the:
disability requirements (s.24)
early intervention requirements (s.25)
both the disability and early intervention requirements.
In the future, participants will be supported by the appropriate participant pathway, depending on how they meet access.
What will the changes to access mean for participants?
In the future, participants will be supported to have a more tailored planning experience and funding outcomes, depending on how they accessed the NDIS.
The impact of this change will happen later, once new pathways are created.
It will take time to create the new pathways, as we will work together with people with disability on how these can be best implemented to ensure the needs of participants and the Agency are met.
How do the changes impact early intervention?
People who meet access to the NDIS under the early intervention requirements will be supported by the new early intervention pathway once it’s created.
Notice of impairments (s32BA)
What is a Notice of Impairments?
Currently, all new participants to the NDIS receive an access decision letter which says if access was met under the disability requirements, the early intervention requirements, or both.
From 1 January 2025, new participants will receive clearer information about how they meet the disability or early intervention requirements. This will include their category of impairment.
The change was recommended by the NDIS Review, and requests from participants for more clarity and transparency about the basis of their access.
There are 6 impairment categories listed in the NDIS Act.
These are:
intellectual
cognitive
sensory
neurological
physical
impairments relating to a psychosocial disability.
The categories and their definitions are outlined in the operational guideline –
Applying to the NDIS
document available on the NDIS website.
For children younger than 6 years old who meet the criteria for developmental delay, the information will say they are eligible under the early intervention requirements with developmental delay.
Why is the NDIS introducing Notice of Impairments?
Providing this information to participants gives them clearer information about how they meet the disability or early intervention requirements.
It responds to NDIS Review recommendations, and requests from participants to have more clarity and transparency about the basis of their access to the NDIS.
This approach also recognises that people with disability who have the same diagnosis may have different impairments and support needs.
What does it mean for me as a new participant (application submitted on or after 1 January 2025)?
Currently, all new participants receive an access decision letter, which says if access was met under the disability requirements, the early intervention requirements, or both.
From 1 January, new participants will receive clearer information about how they meet the disability or early intervention requirements. This will include their category of impairment.
The change was recommended by the NDIS Review, and requests from participants for more clarity and transparency about the basis of their access.
What does it mean for me as an existing participant?
As an existing participant, there is nothing you need to do right now.
We will work with existing participants to make sure they have the information they need ahead of any changes.
What happens if I want to change my category/categories?
A participant, or their nominee, can apply to vary their impairment category at any time after meeting access if it is not, or is no longer, correct.
The type of evidence that is required to support an application will depend on the reason the participant is seeking to vary the information and the evidence that has already been provided.
If the NDIA varies the impairment category, this will be reflected in the participant’s information. If a participant does not agree with the NDIA's decision to vary or not to vary their impairment category, they can ask for a review of the decision.
Support needs assessment (s32L)
What is a support needs assessment?
The NDIS Review recommended a different approach to planning to deliver better and fairer outcomes for NDIS participants.
This included the development of a new way to gather information about the support people need to inform their NDIS Budget, called a support needs assessment.
A support needs assessment is a process that will be used to better understand a participant’s support needs in the future and develop their budget.
It will include a strengths-based assessment that will focus on a participant’s support needs rather than functional capacity.
Support needs assessments are a key step in the NDIS reform process to move toward a better way of planning.
In February 2025, the NDIA released an approach to market for support need assessment tools to support this process.
The NDIA understands the new ways of gathering information will significantly change participants’ experience and we will continue to talk with and listen to the disability community every step of the way.
Read more about support needs assessment tools
.
What's changing now?
For most participants, they will continue to have their plans developed using the current process for some time to come.
It will take 5 years for all participants to have their NDIS budgets developed in this new way. We are taking 5 years to make sure the transition isn't rushed and we continue to learn and improve as we go.
We will continue to talk with and listen to people with disability, their families, carers and representatives as we progress through this year of design and testing, and as we transition to the new way of working.
We will also keep letting everyone know where we are up to in the design and testing, so that the information is available to everyone.
What happens next?
February to April 2025
The first step is to work with people with disability to understand the best ways to collect information about peoples' support needs, and how to use this to build a NDIS budget. People with disability will be involved in choosing the best ways to collect information. We already know that people want us to make this as simple and easy as possible for people, so they don’t need to keep sharing personal information or retelling their story.
The second step is to agree how the NDIA will collect information, how to talk with participants about their NDIS budgets and how they can use it. This includes agreeing how participants can provide information. We know there will be many areas we will need to work through with participants to make sure the system is fair and equitable for people in different circumstances.
We are working with people with disability and disability representatives to design this and will have a proposed approach to share in April 2025.
April to September 2025
The third step is to test the new approach to gathering information and setting a person's NDIS budget to make sure it works well before we start using it. We will include testing the new way of working with participants, without affecting their plans or budgets. We will keep listening and making improvements to the process to reflect the feedback we receive.
From September 2025
We will gradually start working with participants to develop their NDIS budgets using the new approach. We will do this gradually so we can keep testing and improving the way this works.
In this early stage, we will also build in additional checks to make sure the approach is working well, and that participants' NDIS budgets are fair and consistent.
We will start gradually to make sure the new approach works well for participants, and we will continue to learn and improve how to do this well - so we can make the transition a smooth process for participants. We know these changes may create anxiety for people and we want to make the process as clear and as simple as possible for people.
Plan management decisions (s44)
Can I still choose how my NDIS funding is managed?
Yes, you can ask for your plan to be managed in a way that works best for you. This is called a plan management request.
You can choose to:
self-manage your funding
use a plan manager to help you manage your budget
have your funding NDIA-managed.
We want to help you manage your funding safely and confidently. In some cases, if there is an unreasonable risk, we may need to change how your funding is managed.
What has changed in how the NDIA makes decisions about plan management?
New rules now clearly define how we assess unreasonable risk when making plan management decisions.
If there are concerns about how your funding is managed by you, your nominee, a representative or plan manager, we will first look at ways to support you before making any changes.
Extra supports such as guidance, safeguards or other strategies may be offered to help you stay in control of your funding.
A risk is only considered unreasonable if there are no supports that can help manage it.
If we decide to change how your funding is managed, we will:
talk to you first and explain our decision
give you the option to request a review if you don’t agree.
These changes are designed to help you stay in control of your funding while ensuring it is managed safely.
What does the NDIA consider when changing a plan management decision?
When the NDIA decides how plan funds are managed, they will consider if the participant, their nominee or child representative or registered plan manager:
spent funding on NDIS supports
spent funding in line with the participant’s plan
presents an unreasonable risk to the participant by managing their funding.
If risks are identified, the NDIA may not support a participant’s request to self-manage or use a registered plan manager.
What happens if a participant or their nominee have been convicted of a criminal offence?
The NDIA will consider if the participant or their plan nominee have had any major criminal convictions.
The participant’s funding will be Agency-managed if the participant or their nominee have been convicted of an offence that:
carries at least 2 years of prison
involves fraud or dishonesty.
This will apply to all new and reassessed plans where a new plan approval decision is being made.
Can a participant appeal a plan management decision implemented by the NDIA?
Participants can appeal a plan management decision.
They should follow the NDIA appeal process, which includes requesting a review and providing any supporting information.
If a participant’s plan management type is changed, is the participant notified and given reasons why?
We know how important it is for participants to have the control, independence and flexibility in arranging and paying for their own supports through self-management.
The NDIA will talk to the participant about the risks and safeguards they have considered when making a plan management decision.
Where possible, they will support the participant to work towards their preferred plan management type in the future.
Plan variations and reassessments (s47 and s48)
Can I request changes to my NDIS plan?
Yes, if your needs change, you can ask for an update to your NDIS plan at any time.
We will work with you to make sure your supports are updated appropriately.
There are 2 ways your plan can be updated:
Plan variations: small changes can be made without replacing your plan.
Reassessments: a full review of your plan, creating a new plan with a new end date.
We will always explain why a change is needed and work with you on any updates. If you don’t agree, you can request a review, and we will support you through the process.
What has changed about how plans are updated?
From 4 March 2025, new rules will clarify when and how we can vary or reassess a participant’s plan.
These rules ensure:
consistent decision-making when plans need to change
a focus on your needs and goals when updating supports
more flexibility while protecting participant funding.
These changes do not affect your right to request a plan variation or reassessment. They simply make the process clearer and ensure updates are made in a fair and transparent way.
Right to appeal decisions
Will participants have the right to appeal agency decisions that they are not happy with, for example changes to how their plan is managed and the funding periods?
Participants can appeal a decision to approve a plan, which includes how the plan will be managed. They can also appeal a decision relating to funding periods.
They should follow the NDIA appeal process, which includes requesting a review and providing any supporting information.
Can participants still review decisions made by the Agency?
NDIS participants have always and will continue to have the right to review their NDIS package and level of supports.
These legislative changes passed by Parliament do not change that right.
Providers
What is providers’ responsibility when delivering supports? (new)
Providers are responsible for delivering supports in line with the participant's plan. This includes confirming the participant’s plan has sufficient funding within each funding period and support category to meet their needs.
This requirement has not changed with the introduction of funding periods.
How should providers schedule and claim for supports? (new)
Providers should schedule and claim for supports within the participant’s available budget and funding periods. Claims submitted within a funding period where funds have been exhausted will be rejected.
If there are unspent funds within a funding period, these funds will roll over into the next funding period. This roll over ensures that participants can continue to access supports if they did not fully use their funding in the previous funding period.
Can a provider claim across multiple funding periods? (new)
Yes. If a service spans multiple funding periods, providers are not required to lodge separate claims. As long as there is enough budget in both funding periods to cover the full amount, a claim can be submitted for the entire service.
Claims will be processed based on the available budget, regardless of the support dates.
Why is it important for providers to avoid over servicing? (new)
Over servicing occurs when services are delivered beyond the allocated budget for a given funding period, with the expectation that the claim will be paid using the next funding period’s allocation. While this may seem convenient, it creates risk. If a provider delivers more services than funded in a period, there may not be sufficient funding to cover the participant’s support requirements for the duration of their plan.
Under NDIS legislation, claims exceeding the available funding in a support category in the current funding period cannot be paid.
To ensure both providers and participants are protected, it is essential to deliver services within the participant’s budget and funding periods. Avoiding over-servicing, especially if funding is nearing its limit, ensures continuity of supports and prevents financial risks for participants and providers.
What if a participants’ needs change? (new)
Participants can request changes to their funding periods if their needs change, such as if they need more or less support. They will need to submit a plan change request and provide information explaining why the change is necessary. The NDIS will review the request and where appropriate, work with the participant to adjust their plan.
Plan variations
If a participant’s overall support needs haven’t changed, but they need to adjust how the funds are used over time (for example, to access a temporary increase in funding for a program like intensive capacity building or early intervention), they may request a plan variation. This allows funds to be reallocated within the current period, with less funding allocated to later periods.
This process does not require a full plan reassessment, but careful budgeting is necessary, as less funding will be available in later periods. The total funding amount will remain unchanged.
In some cases, if a participant knows in advance that they will need additional support (such as early intervention), their plan can be frontloaded, giving them more funding early on so they don’t need to return to the Agency if their needs change during the plan.
Plan reassessments
Plan reassessments are when we create a whole new plan with a participant, that has a new plan end date. Reassessments provide a more detailed review of a participants plan if they have more significant changes to their current circumstances, to ensure funding and supports continue to meet their needs over time.
The process for requesting a change to a plan has not changed with the introduction of funding periods.
Do claims need to be submitted within 2 years of support being provided? Is there a grace period?
Claims and payments (s45)
In the future, all claims must be made within 2 years of providing the support.
For the first 12 months the NDIA will review all claims made for supports provided before the new NDIS law comes into effect on 3 October 2024.
How can providers register for community participation?
Providers can register by visiting the
NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission
website and following the registration process.
How do providers and plan managers claim replacement supports?
Providers and plan managers must not provide or claim a replacement support for a participant without evidence of approval.

We are committed to making our website and documents accessible and inclusive for all users, including people with disability. Wherever possible, we aim to write content in plain English to ensure information is easy to understand and use.
Some information on this website may not meet plain English or Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) due to the use of technical, regulatory, or legal terminology.
This information is written to align with specific legislative or policy frameworks and must retain certain language to ensure legal accuracy and compliance.
We acknowledge that this may make some information more difficult to understand. If you need help interpreting or understanding any content on our website, please contact us.
We are happy to provide support or offer alternative formats upon request.
Overview
Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) is housing designed for people with an extreme functional impairment or very high support needs.
SDA funding is only provided for NDIS participants who meet strict eligibility criteria.
The NDIA does not build, own, commission or lease SDA. The upfront cost to build or buy an SDA dwelling comes from an owner or investor in the dwelling.
Investment in SDA, like any other type of investment, carries risks. Prospective investors should carefully assess the information and investment proposals provided to them, complete due diligence and seek independent legal and financial advice when deciding whether to invest in SDA.
The NDIA is not legally responsible for the construction, maintenance or tenancy of SDA dwellings. For example, the NDIA is not responsible for ensuring that SDA dwellings meet State and Territory building codes, planning or other regulations. This is the owner or investor’s responsibility.
An owner or investor may enter into a commercial arrangement with third parties (e.g. builders, developers and SDA providers) for the construction, maintenance or tenancy of SDA dwellings.
The NDIA is not a party to these arrangements and cannot resolve disputes arising under these agreements.
The NDIA does not guarantee investment returns for SDA dwellings.
SDA investment considerations
Prospective investors should conduct their own due diligence and seek independent legal and financial advice when deciding whether to invest in SDA. This includes, but is not limited to:
Understanding SDA market dynamics
SDA is a niche market. Information about local demand, supply, vacancy rates, and drivers for SDA may be relevant considerations when deciding whether to invest in SDA.
Find out more about our
SDA data
.
Being aware of claims regarding exaggerated or guaranteed investment returns
The NDIA and the Australian Government do not guarantee, back or assure investment returns for SDA. Prospective investors carry the risks of their investment. This includes vacancy risk.
The
NDIS Pricing Arrangements for Specialist Disability Accommodation
set out the maximum amount that the NDIA will pay for the SDA. The rates are set through a legislative framework to generate appropriate returns for risk in investing in SDA.  Further detail is available in the SDA Price Review Final Report.
Owners and investors may wish to exercise caution with any investment opportunity claiming guaranteed or excessively high returns.
Identifying a quality SDA provider
Owners or investors will enter into a commercial agreement with an SDA provider to provide SDA to a participant/s at the owner or investor’s dwelling. Among other things, the agreement should set how much the SDA provider will pay the owner or investor for the use of their dwelling.
The SDA provider has a range of obligations under the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 (NDIS Act), including applying to enrol the dwelling as SDA with the NDIA, meeting the conditions of enrolment of the dwelling, and entering into a written SDA service agreement with the participant, or participants, who live in the dwelling and receive SDA support from the SDA provider.
SDA providers must be registered through the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission with the SDA registration group approved and maintain this registration to provide SDA supports to participants.
Understanding specific design and build requirements
The NDIA has detailed design requirements for all newly built SDA, set out in the
SDA Design Standard
.
Dwellings intended for use as SDA are also required to meet local, state and national construction codes and planning regulations.
Understanding the SDA enrolment process and requirements
A dwelling is not SDA until it is enrolled by the NDIA. We decide whether to enrol a dwelling as SDA, when an SDA provider submits a completed application to enrol the dwelling with the NDIA, after the dwelling is built.
The NDIA will not enrol a dwelling if the provider and the dwelling don’t meet the requirements for enrolment under the SDA Rules at the time of the dwelling enrolment decision. For example, we won’t enrol a dwelling if it doesn’t:
meet the
SDA Design Standard
have the features of an SDA building type
meet density restrictions, or other requirements in the
SDA Rules
.
An SDA provider can’t claim payments for support they provide to a participant in a dwelling if the dwelling is not enrolled as SDA.
Further information on SDA dwelling enrolment requirements can be found via our website:
SDA dwelling enrolment and vacancies
.
Understanding how and when you will receive SDA income
SDA providers make claims to the NDIA for SDA support provided to participants. Participants pay for SDA support from their NDIS plan funding.
SDA providers can’t submit a claim for SDA support to the NDIA until the relevant dwelling is enrolled as SDA and is occupied by an eligible participant who has a service agreement in place with the SDA provider.
How owners and investors receive income from the SDA provider is a commercial agreement between these parties. The NDIA is not a party to these agreements and cannot resolve disputes arising under these agreements.
Owners and investors (unless they are also the SDA provider) can’t make SDA claims to the NDIA.
The NDIS Act and Privacy Act 1988 dictate when the NDIA can disclose participant information and other information held in the records of the Agency. SDA providers will also need to comply with the requirements in the NDIS Act and Privacy Act 1988 when disclosing this information to owners and investors.
Understanding the difference between rent and SDA payments
There is a difference between rental payments and payments for SDA.
The NDIS funds NDIS supports. SDA is a NDIS support that can be funded through the NDIS. Certain day-to-day living costs, including rent, are not a NDIS support that can be funded through the NDIS. Further information about NDIS supports can be found on the ‘
What is a NDIS support
’ landing page of the NDIS website.
In addition to SDA payments, participants pay a reasonable rent contribution to the SDA provider and other day to day living costs such as electricity bills for the SDA dwelling.
The amount of the reasonable rent contribution should be included in the service agreement between the participant and the SDA provider, or in a separate tenancy agreement between the participant and the SDA provider. Tenancy agreements must meet the requirements of relevant state and territory tenancy legislation. The NDIA is not a party to these agreements and cannot resolve disputes arising under these arrangements. You may wish to familiarise yourself with tenancy legislation applicable in the state or territory the dwelling is located in and seek independent advice if required.
The amount of rent a SDA provider can charge a participant who lives in SDA must not exceed the maximum reasonable rent contribution (MRRC) published in the
NDIS Specialist Disability Accommodation Pricing Arrangements
.
Understanding participant choice and needs
The NDIA does not “place” or “match” participants to an SDA dwelling. This includes where a vacancy is created in a dwelling when a participant leaves. It is the choice of the participant where they live.
Remember, you won’t receive income from an SDA dwelling if an eligible participant is not living in the dwelling.
The location and quality of your property plays a significant role in its attractiveness to potential tenants. SDA should be located on well sited blocks, which provide access to outdoor areas and promote inclusion in the neighbourhood and local community.
The proximity to essential services has a significant influence on the property’s desirability and long-term tenancy. These include:
accessible public transport
healthcare
education
shopping
recreational facilities
the availability of other supports.
The decision to accept a participant as a tenant in the SDA dwelling is a matter between the SDA provider and owner and investor.
Tenant selection should always consider how the attributes of the SDA dwelling in combination with the other supports a person has (if known) will achieve the best possible outcomes for the tenant.
The compatibility of tenants in shared living environments is also an important consideration.
Misleading information in the SDA market
The NDIA is aware of misleading and deceptive advertising in the SDA market.
Some examples of problematic advertising include:
Guaranteed return on investment or profitability
Guaranteed occupancy
SDA properties are more secure investments than other types of investments (i.e. recession proof investment, guaranteed income, etc.)
SDA properties having secure government funding or are ‘government-backed’.
These types of claims may be false or misleading. Investment in SDA carries risk like any other investment and profitability depends on many factors including:
Income from an SDA dwelling is not guaranteed as the property may be unoccupied or partially occupied for periods of time. Funding for SDA applies to the participant(s) NDIS Plan and not the dwelling and as such cannot be guaranteed.
The NDIA is not involved with day-to-day management of SDA dwellings. Investors enter an arrangement with an SDA provider to find occupants and manage operations and transactions relating to the property.
Enrolment of the dwelling as SDA can only happen once the enrolment requirements have been met and on completion of building.
Whether a participant’s plan includes SDA, and how much SDA funding is included in the plan will depend on the participant’s individual circumstances and disability support needs.
NDIS participants have choice and control over their housing and occupancy of a property depends on individual requirements. It is important to be aware that:
the dwelling type may not meet individual NDIS participant requirements given its location, design and the quality of the dwelling
a dwelling with multiple rooms may not attract multiple NDIS participants to reach full occupancy
demand will vary in different geographic locations.
We continue to work collaboratively with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission (NQSC), as required to address any concerning market behaviours and act against those advertisers.
Advertising a dwelling as SDA
We have observed increases in advertisements promoting dwellings as SDA before their enrolment by the NDIA.
A dwelling is not considered an ‘enrolled SDA dwelling’ until:
the dwelling is fully built and complete, and
the NDIA approves the application to enrol the dwelling as SDA.
Any representation of a dwelling as an ‘enrolled SDA dwelling’ prior to this approval should be approached with care.
NDIS logo guidelines
The NDIA is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the NDIS and its brand.
Refer to the
NDIS logo guidelines
to ensure correct usage.
Contracts for building and managing SDA dwellings
When considering entering a contract for an SDA dwelling, you should read and understand the terms of the agreement. This includes any terms that may be unfair. Investors should seek independent advice before entering into an agreement.
Under the Australian Consumer Law, unfair contract terms are prohibited in standard form consumer and small business agreements. A term may be considered unfair if:
it would cause a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the
contract
;
it is not reasonably necessary in order to protect the legitimate interests of the
party
who would be advantaged by the term
it would cause detriment (whether financial or otherwise) to a party if it were to be applied or relied on.
Investors should be cautious of any terms in an agreement that allow:
for properties to be unoccupied or not occupied to capacity for long periods of time, without a right to terminate the agreement
the SDA provider has wide discretion to change the terms of the agreement
SDA providers have wide discretion to charge for goods or services relating to management or limits your ability to dispute charges
SDA providers are able to acquire goods or services from related companies, without the consent of the investor
an SDA provider to unnecessarily limit their liability for loss or damage to the property.
Seeking independent advice and resolving issues
When you are considering SDA investment, it is important to seek independent legal and financial advice before entering a commercial contract.  Given the commercial nature of these contracts, other Government Agencies may also be able to assist you to resolve disputes arising under the contract.
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is Australia’s competition, consumer, fair trading and product safety regulator. The ACCC accepts reports of consumer issues and provides information on the Australian Consumer Law including:
False or misleading claims
Unfair contract terms
Unfair business practices including unconscionable conduct
You can contact the ACCC on 1300 302 502 or make an
enquiry
.
Australian Securities & Investment Commission
The
Australian Securities & Investments Commission
(ASIC) is Australia's integrated corporate, markets, financial services, and consumer credit regulator.
Moneysmart is one way to identify any concerning behaviours within the market and is led by ASIC.
As a prospective investor in SDA, it is recommended that you engage with Moneysmart before making major financial decisions.
Moneysmart provides useful information for people considering making investment decisions including:
Choosing a super fund
SMSFs and property
Property schemes
Investment warnings
You can contact ASIC on 1300 300 630 or lodge a
report
.
National Disability Insurance Scheme Quality and Safeguards Commission
The
NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission
registers and regulates NDIS providers. It was established to help uphold the integrity of the NDIS by ensuring providers adhere to the relevant codes of conduct and National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 provisions.
As an SDA investor, you must either be an SDA registered provider or enter into an agreement with an SDA registered provider. When engaging with an SDA registered provider, it is important to know their obligations.
You can find more information about the
NDIS Code of Conduct
for NDIS registered providers via the NDIS Quality & Safeguards Commission website.
You can contact the Commission on 1800 035 544 or
email
.
Fraud
The NDIA and Australian Government are taking stronger measures to find and stop fraud and serious organised crime in the NDIS and other government programs.
Fraud is illegal and we have zero tolerance for anyone attempting to exploit the NDIS. Individuals or organisations found to be engaging in fraudulent activity will be removed from participation in the NDIS and may be referred to law enforcement agencies for investigation.
We are committed to protecting all NDIS participants’ safety and wellbeing and safeguarding the integrity of the NDIS.
All suspicious and fraudulent practices in the SDA market should be
reported
to us.

Information for SDA investors

Save page as PDF
8 July 2025
The NDIA has created a new dedicated webpage for Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) investors.
The new webpage provides SDA investors with more detailed information about SDA investment considerations and important alerts on misleading information in the SDA market, advertising and unfair contract terms.
The webpage also includes guidance on other government agencies that can provide information, advice or support to resolve issues that may arise when investing in SDA.
The information has been developed in collaboration with:
NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission
Australian Securities and Investments Commission
, and
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
.
Investors should be wary of false or misleading claims regarding SDA investment.
The NDIA does not guarantee investment returns for SDA dwellings. We are not legally responsible for the construction, maintenance or tenancy of SDA – these are commercial arrangements between an investor and other parties, such as the SDA provider.
The webpage provides general information only. Prospective SDA investors should always conduct their own thorough due diligence and seek independent legal and financial advice when deciding whether to invest in SDA.
We are committed to protecting all NDIS participants’ safety and wellbeing and safeguarding the integrity of the NDIS.
All suspicious and fraudulent practices in the SDA market should be
reported to us
.
To further support SDA investors, the NDIA will also be delivering online information sessions on integrity in the SDA market later this year.
These will be advertised via our website closer to the session dates.

Assessments and Budgeting co-design working group meeting April 2025
Listen
Print this page
Save page as PDF
29 April 2025
What we talked about
Topic 1: Reset of co-design for NDIS reforms, working group ways of working
The NDIA discussed the changes to the co-design working group, explained the focus on new framework planning, and asked for any feedback on the Terms of Reference or how the group could work together.
Topic 2: Co-design workplan
The NDIA drafted a workplan to outline in scope and out of scope deliverables, and co-design/engagements activities to support the initiative. Due to time constraints, it was agreed this would be a topic for a separate dedicated session.
Topic 3: Guiding principles for the budgeting approach
The NDIA presented a draft of 10 guiding principles that would be used to guide the budget model for feedback.
What we heard
The group asked for clarity of scope and role of the group. It was confirmed the group will be planning co-design activities, giving direct feedback about key topics, considering insights from other engagement activities related to the workplan.
The group asked for clarity about what and how they can share with their networks to allow for more informed discussions, to support the NDIA to co-design more broadly and let the group promote activities with their networks.
There is a need to develop a better way of working. The group discussed:
2 hours a month online can be challenging for the voices of all to be heard and achieve workplan deliverables.
The group is still understanding how each person works and how to best work together.
ideas about how the group could come together to build a strong working relationship and be more productive.
The group all agreed in calling out the principle of “Consistent”:
They said the dollar amount of a budget shouldn’t necessarily be similar between similar participants. This is not a reliable benchmark for fairness and equity.
The complexity of individual budgets means there aren’t two people with “the same circumstances”.
They advised that the process and decision making needs to be fair and equitable.
The NDIA needs to be fair and transparent with participants about how budgets are calculated, so that participants understand their total budget amount shouldn’t be compared to that of others.
The group questioned why certain principles like Human Rights were not included. It was agreed:
Principles that apply to the NDIS Act also apply to budget method, we should not duplicate these, but a statement should be made to clarify the relationship between the principles and the Act.
The NDIA should review these principles in context with the Act.
The group discussed how goals would inform budgets:
The NDIA proposed some goals, not all, would inform budgets – there was concern there would be difficulty aligning this with person-centred and holistic practice.
The group agreed NDIA should be clear about which goals would have an impact on budgets, and how.
Group members discussed principles that are contradictory.
It was agreed there are tensions between some principles. This needs to be acknowledged, particularly relating to ‘Consistent’, ‘Individualised’ and ‘Financial Sustainability’.
The NDIA should be clear about the detail of how the principles will be used when there are conflicting priorities.
The group discussed the principle that contained financial sustainability:
They said it shouldn’t be the sole responsibility of participants.
They said financial impacts should consider the whole of government and related spending.
They asked about “cultural safety” and how it would be used. They discussed the possible meanings of “culture” and asked the NDIA to be clear about it.
Group members suggested proactive mitigation of risks to participants could be used. This might mean making sure participants have enough funds to quickly replace damaged supports.
The group asked about what work has been done, and whether the model has been developed.
The NDIA advised the budget model has not been developed and will be very different to current state.
‘Typical Support Packages’ will not be used as the basis for setting participant budgets in new framework planning.
They advised thorough communication was needed from the NDIA to explain the changes, and answer questions to participants, providers and the sector.
What we agreed to do
Finalise and disseminate the Terms of Reference.
Schedule session to work through the revised workplan, noting this was an optional session.
Review budget principles in context of the NDIS Act to make sure they work together and don’t duplicate.
NDIA to review the budget principles presented based on the group’s feedback.
Who we met with
Participants, Disability Representative and Carer Organisations, Independent Advisory Council and Reference Group members, subject matter experts and NDIA staff.

5 June 2025
What we talked about
Topic 1: co-design and ways of working
The group discussed the time, resources, and information needed to co-design.
Topic 2: participant experience of new assessments
The NDIA shared an overview of the participant journey. It focussed on preparing for a support needs assessment and the new assessment process.
The group discussed key stages in the participant journey and gave feedback on details that need to be considered.
What we heard
How we co-design
Playing back what we heard is important. The NDIA should show what has changed and give stakeholders a chance to validate insights.
Communicating about the new participant journey
The NDIA should explain why participants need to go through the assessment process.
The NDIA needs to use realistic examples in communications, rather than showing the “happy path”. Acknowledge the complexity for participants and talk about what happens when something goes wrong.
Who participants work with in the new planning process
The different roles and people a participant will work with need clarifying. Participants don’t want to have to talk to lots of new people about the same thing.
There are risks around participants and staff having different priorities. Staff need to be appropriately recruited and trained, and the process needs to be trauma informed.
Clear understanding of what information a participant will be asked for at every step is important.
A trusted health professional may be better to give information about a participant. Participants know who knows them best and who they trust to share information about their disability and support needs.
Concern about needing to engage with an unknown allied health professional for an assessment.
The participant experience
It is unclear how the support needs assessment is linked to other parts of the participant journey, e.g. access and using their plan.
There are opportunities to understand participants more holistically, including how other health conditions and circumstances change the support they might need.
Understanding the support needs assessment, when it starts, what is involved, and making sure there is informed consent is essential.
Each participant will have a unique experience. Each of the steps in the process needs to be customisable to suit each participant.
Participants should be able to see and validate the information the NDIA is collecting.
The time needed to complete an assessment and receive a budget may result in a negative experience for some participants.
What we agreed to do
Finalise terms of reference with clear information on the role of the group.
Give the group clear updates on actions.
Review how much information can be shared to enable deeper discussions.
Continue work on the new participant pathway and experience based on the group's advice, input and feedback.
Who we met with
Participants, Disability Representative and Carer Organisations, Independent Advisory Council and Reference Group members, subject matter experts and NDIA staff.

What we talked about
Topic 1: NDIA update
Aaron Verlin, General Manager Co-design and Engagement, provided the following update.
The NDIA undertook a co-design reset in April 2025 to refocus efforts on four key areas to support the delivery of the new NDIS planning pathway:
Assessments and Budgeting
Navigators
Participant Pathway Experience, and
Participant Safeguarding.
The co-design Home and Living, Workforce Capability, and Integrity working groups have paused. Reform work in these areas will continue through alternative engagement methods.
The Agency recognises co-design needs to happen beyond the co-design working groups to ensure broader representation across disability types and regions. The Agency is committed to giving more people opportunity to contribute to co-design reform through Agency reference and advisory groups, and participant focus groups.
The NDIA’s reform agenda is structured into five Horizons from 2025 to post-2030. Horizon 1 focuses on key deliverables for 2025 including:
notice of impairments
support needs assessments
navigation design
workforce capability, and
how we communicate with participants about their budget.
The NDIA is committed to providing the disability community greater visibility of its co-design activities. The Agency will publish monthly co-design summaries on the NDIS website, including key insights, actions and outcomes. It will also support organisations to share updates with members and networks.
The Co-design Advisory Group is evaluating current NDIA co-design practices. It will focus on supporting internal and external capability to ensure Agency co-design remains genuine, inclusive, and continues to improve.
Topic 2: New participant pathway participant experience
The Access Planning and Pathway Branch provided an overview of the proposed participant experience of the new participant pathway, before leading breakout room consultation sessions with attendees.
The new pathway will create a more consistent, participant focused experience guided by trained needs support accessors. The approach prioritises clarity, continuity, and flexibility, while addressing stakeholder concerns about communication, decision-making support, and the emotional impact of change.
The new participant pathway has five key stages including:
the notice of impairment
preparing for a support needs assessment
the support needs assessment meeting
receiving a budget and plan, and
actioning a plan.
What we heard
Summary of key insights and themes from the new participant pathway breakout room discussions:
Clear communication is essential: Participants need simple, timely, and accessible information about each step of the process.
Support for decision-making is critical: People must be supported to make informed choices, including those who may not traditionally receive decision-making support.
Build trust through respect and continuity: Participants want to feel safe, respected, and understood. Need to embed trauma-informed, culturally safe practices.
Assessment must be fair and flexible: One-size-fits-all tools won’t work. There needs to be flexibility for complex or changing needs.
Clarify roles and improve navigation: The system must clearly explain who does what and when, and be easy to navigate.
Identify and manage risks early: Risks include miscommunication, exclusion due to lack of evidence, and pressure to exaggerate needs.
Co-design and sector collaboration matter: Participants and sector representatives want to help shape the process, test materials, and support outreach.
Topic 3: New participant pathway change approach
Julie Fayers, Branch Manager Strategic Change, delivered the final session on how to effectively manage and communicate the changes involved in transitioning participants to the new participant pathway.
Breakout room consultation was held to explore the types of support participants may need to navigate the upcoming changes.
What we heard
Summary of key insights and themes from the participant pathway change management breakout room discussions:
Communicate clearly, early, and accessibly: Provide timely, plain-language information in accessible formats. Information should be framed around why it matters to participants, including reassuring participants they won’t be worse off.
Provide support and follow-up: Participants should have a named contact person or trusted organisation to work with them through the process. Supported decision-making and advocacy referrals should be built in.
Use trusted messengers and empower peer networks: Deliver messages through peers, community leaders, and disability organisations. Create safe spaces for dialogue and enable two-way communication where participants can ask questions and be heard.
Supported decision-making and trusted relationships: Enable participants to involve trusted supporters and provide access to independent, conflict-free advocacy.
Co-design and pre-communication help: Co-design communication with the disability community including testing materials before publishing. Brief disability organisations and community leaders in advance so they can help explain the changes.
Train and align the workforce: Ensure all staff are trained to deliver consistent messages.
Ensure assessor capability: Ensure all assessors are trained in disability-specific, cultural, and trauma-informed approaches. Use multiple or specialist assessors when needed.
Continuity, trust, and emotional safety: Ensure consistent personnel, adopt trauma-informed and culturally safe practices, and offer flexible meeting formats.
Accessibility and transparency of information: Provide participants with access to their records and clear explanation of what the NDIA knows.

Participant Pathway Experience Co-design Working Group 6 May 2025

28 May 2025
“What do you want to say that we haven’t asked you?” A suggestion from a working group member of a question the NDIA needs to ask members. A powerful way to uncover insights that might otherwise be missed.
What we talked about
The Participant Pathway Experience and how we can strengthen our Co-design approach
The NDIA shared updates on the revised workplan. The commitment is to be more transparent about what is in and out of scope, and to make sure diverse voices are included in the reform process. Meetings will begin with clear objectives and expected outcomes, and summaries will be shared in plain English instead of long minutes.
The group discussed how the work of the Participant Pathway Experience Co-design Working Group fits in with legislative changes led by the Department of Social Services (DSS). While DSS leads on legislation, this group focuses on service design and improving the participant experience. There is opportunity to influence how things are delivered by the NDIA even if some rules are final
Insights for New Framework Planning
NDIA presented insights gathered from participants over the past six months and highlighted five key moments in the planning journey from the initial preparation meeting to implementation
What we heard
Participants want clarity, continuity, and to feel respected and heard. They also want flexibility in how they engage with the NDIA and control over their personal information. Avoiding the need for participants to repeat their story multiple times.
Consider renaming of the “Notice of Impairment” to make it clearer and more respectful. This change will help participants understand what information the NDIA holds and how it is used. The importance of including accessibility and safety needs in planning conversations was also emphasised.
The return of the participant workbook is welcomed, as it helps people prepare and leads to better outcomes. It was also suggested that preparation meetings could be a time to support participants in completing a workbook.
The NDIA added that while it is important to gather relevant information, the Agency needs to be clear about what the NDIS can and cannot fund.
Respectful and transparent practices must apply across all meetings. Participants feel ambushed in so-called “check-ins” where major decisions are made without their input. Respectful, transparent engagement must extend to reviews and reassessments, not just initial planning. Planners often arrive unprepared, unaware of participants’ disabilities or history, which erodes trust.
Participants want to feel safe, known, and in control. The phrase “safe and known” needs to be clearly defined and backed by action—not just words. Participants want to be seen as whole people, not just their disability. They value agency. That is, control over what information they share and how it’s shared.
What we agreed on
There was a broader conversation about how meetings are run. Not everyone can attend frequently, so feedback methods need to be flexible—surveys, collaborative tools, and email submissions were all suggested. Some participants prefer longer monthly meetings, while some organisation representatives prefer shorter, focused ones. Some participants shared that they prefer to give feedback in the moment due to memory and communication challenges.
NDIA suggested starting meetings with an Easy English agenda, setting aside time for personal experiences, and being upfront about what will and will not be covered. The Agency committed to providing transcripts, locking in meeting dates, and being transparent about what each session will involve.
To make it easier to share what’s happening, we’ll move away from long meeting minutes. Instead, you’ll get a simple two-page summary covering: what we heard, what we discussed and what’s happening next.  The goal is to be more open and make it easy for you to share updates in plain English with your networks—so everyone stays in the loop on what’s happening in the co-design space.
What we will do next
The group wrapped up with a shared understanding that while everyone has different needs and preferences, the goal is to make the process more inclusive, respectful, and participant-focused.
Provide an overview of the New Framework Planning for working group members on 20 May 2025.
The next working group meeting is on 10 June 2025.
Who we met with
Participants, Disability Representative and Carer Organisations, Independent Advisory Council and Reference Group members, subject matter experts and NDIA staff.

Navigator meeting co-design working group meeting 7 summary

Save page as PDF
14 July 2025
Friday 13 June 2025
What we talked about
Topic 1: Reset of co-design for National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) reforms, working group ways of working
The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) discussed recent work with the sector to focus co-design work on 4 main areas – Navigation, Assessment and Budgeting, Participant Safeguarding and Participant Pathway Experience.
The NDIA aims to increase the depth and breadth of its engagement activities with participants, the market and Disability Representative and Carer Organisations (DRCOs).
The Navigator co-design working group (working group) is seen as having a critical role in:
leading and informing the engagement that should occur with participants
leading and guiding the best approaches to participant engagement activities in focus groups – for example, through topics discussed or questions asked.
Working group meetings will be moved to every 8 weeks and will run for a shorter time. This will allow enough time for the NDIA to set up each phase of focus groups, analyse the information and report back to the working group.
Topic 2: Engagement updates – NDIA and Sector-led
Update from Scott Fitzpatrick, Navigator initiative lead
In June, the NDIA met with State and Territory departments with disability responsibilities to discuss the Navigators service design and separately, with the CEOs of Partners in the Community organisations.
The NDIA’s CEO also met with DRCOs to get their views on the Navigator reforms and service design.
The NDIA noted that there will be significant levels of engagement over the next 2 years as Navigator functions are designed and delivered.
Update from Bronwyn Morkham, Navigator co-design working group co-chair
There is a general sense in the sector that it had not developed a position on the Navigator role. The sector held meetings with disability representative organisations and DRCOs with the intention to share those findings with the working group. The recent reset had paused this activity.
Topic 3: Future engagement activities and workplan
The NDIA will be sharing a draft workplan with planned engagement activities for the working group to review and give feedback.
The draft includes proposed topics and stakeholders and participant groups prioritised for engagement.
Topic 4: New Framework Planning (NFP) Participant experience
The NDIA presented a conceptual design of the participant experience under new framework planning.
What we heard
The working group asked if there were opportunities for members to take part in the focus groups and / or facilitate sessions – noting the skills required to facilitate these sessions and the experiences of the group that could be drawn upon.
It is critical to recognise the disability sector isn’t homogeneous and that there are different ways people access and receive services. For example, for deaf and blind communities there could be limits to who could access Navigators if they hold insufficient skill sets.
When engaging, it is important to use simple language with direct questions – avoiding jargon wherever possible. An example could be asking specifically what they believe a Navigator should do or what would help make participants more self-sufficient or in control of their lives.
There are opportunities to learn from other organisations that have previously led focus groups with participants and people with disability (e.g. Brotherhood of St Laurence, Neuromuscular WA).
It is important to hold focus groups with a range of different participant groups including people with psychosocial disability, participants from culturally and linguistically diverse communities, and participants who are Deaf and / or Blind. Peer-facilitated focus groups could improve how focus groups are run and enable more genuine and honest feedback.
Some participants are non-speaking or not able to engage in written surveys and papers, so the engagement process should capture these cohorts in different ways.
Some participants also display challenging behaviours. There is a role for parents or nominees to participate in focus groups for participants who are unable to do so due to disability type or barriers to participation.
The engagement process should capture the views of participants who are not using support coordination or do not have access to it due to their plans – to understand what they believe that a Navigator should be doing for them.
There is potential to explore what type of services or support participants believe would best suit them as they move through different life stages. For example, whether participants prefer to work directly with specialists / subject matter experts in transition periods (e.g. moving out of home),or work directly with somebody who knows and understands their situation but may need additional support during these transitions.
Sometimes participants think that intermediaries – such as interpreters – are representing the NDIA, rather than simply conveying information. This can lead to confusion about the interpreter’s role and difficulty distinguishing between the interpreter and the NDIA.
Participants and their nominees are having difficulty understanding the new funding periods and what this means for them. There should be a role for Navigators in supporting participants’ understanding of these kinds of changes.
The NFP process requires multiple actors as part of the assessment process which can be a stressful and unsettling process for people if needing to re-tell their stories. The NDIA should consider if this process can be more streamlined or if there’s a role for a support coordinator to participate in meetings.
The NFP processes require letters to be sent to participants. The Agency should make sure recipients of NDIA letters not only receive them but are able to open and understand the information. Receiving correspondence from government agencies can be a stressful experience for participants and people with a disability.
Navigators should have specific disability skills when working with different groups (for example psychosocial skills when working with psychosocial disability). This is also relevant under all stages of the planning process and the skillsets and experience of everyone who will be working directly with participants.
The NDIS system is quite stretched with intermediaries not having the time or capacity that they would like. The NDIA needs to communicate to support coordinators its expectations on how they will need to help participants implement their plan. Possible ways to do this could be through video content explaining steps and processes and some information sessions with support coordinators. Support coordinators may require more funding and a lower workload if they are expected to take on more work under the NFP process.
Intermediaries (plan managers, support coordinators, local area coordinators) have a range of tools and resources to help support their work with participants. It was strongly recommend to engage with them rather than create new tools when these may already exist. This could be helpful for monitoring under the new planning process.
What we agreed to do
Recirculate for new members a copy of earlier findings from engagement activities with support coordinators.
Provide further information on best practice approaches to focus group engagement and potential involvement of working group members.
Share a summary of the key themes raised during engagement activities to date.
Develop a forward workplan outlining planned engagement activities, focus groups and potential topics and share this with the working group for feedback.
Circulate a copy of the Independent Pricing Committee report and its commentary about Navigators being funded through a commissioned model.
Who we met with
Participants, Disability Representative and Carer Organisations, Independent Advisory Council and Reference Group members, subject matter experts and NDIA staff.

Join us for an informative webinar on Pathways to post school life. This is part of ‘Understanding the NDIS’ series of information sessions.
When an NDIS participant leaves school, there are a number of pathways and supports available to help young people build skills to prepare for their transition from school, and support them in achieving employment and other goals. Their choice depends on their aspirations, skills, abilities and interests.
This webinar will help students with a disability, their parents, carers and education professionals to learn about the supports available to help them prepare for employment after school.
For any enquiries regarding this session, please contact
[email protected]
and include the session name in the subject line.

We are pleased to advise that existing agreements with our partners in the community have been extended to 30 June 2027.
These extensions ensure continuing support to people with disability and NDIS participants, as NDIS reforms continue to improve the Scheme to deliver better outcomes for participants.
There will be no changes for participants and their families and carers. Partners will deliver similar services for individuals, to support people with disability to connect to the NDIS and assist NDIS participants to implement and utilise their plans.
Our early childhood and local area coordination partners play a valuable role in supporting our participants. We are pleased they will continue to provide their services to the community.

Neurodegenerative, Palliative Care and Rare Diseases Advisory Group Meeting March 2025
Listen

Save page as PDF
26 March 2025
The Neurodegenerative, Palliative Care and Rare Diseases (NPR) Advisory Group met online on 26 March 2025.
The Chair, Ms. Prue Coroneos, General Manager, Policy, Evidence and Practice Leadership, National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), welcomed everyone to the meeting.
Ms. Coroneos formally welcomed Ms. Olivia Nassaris, CEO Parkinson’s Australia as co-chair of the group, and thanked Ms. Nassaris for undertaking the role. Co-chairing will ensure that the meetings are meaningful for everyone.
Focus of the meeting
The meeting covered:
Member reporting – discussion of issues raised by members.
Practice Improvement – Technical Advice and Practice Improvement Branch provided an update to the group on progress of disability snapshots
Modifications to the assessment and budgeting approach – Assessment and Budgeting Initiative team provided an update to members.
Member reporting
The newly implemented members reporting document was discussed. This document is updated prior to every meeting and invites members to table issues on behalf of their communities and members. Issues are logged for future meeting agendas and inform updates to the work plan. Forward agenda items include priority access processes, evidence requirements, and early onset dementia.
Practice improvements
The NDIA Technical Advice and Practice Improvement Branch shared an update on disability snapshots that are used by staff to help inform the way they work with participants.
The team are updating current snapshots and are developing a range of new snapshots. They asked to work with members to review existing snapshots and provide input into new snapshots.
Assessment and Budgeting Approach
The NDIA Assessment and Budgeting Initiative team shared information about how the Agency will modify the new approach to delivering support needs assessments and more flexible budgets to better support participants with rapidly changing support needs.
Members shared their expertise, including considering further consultation with peak bodies that hold expertise and knowledge, to ensure the assessment process is appropriate for participants with degenerative conditions. Members recommended that assessments be held in person and be as personalised as much as the participant would like it to be. They also emphasised the importance of ensuring the same level of skilled workforce is able to service remote locations. Members also discussed the need for participants to be able to unlock additional funding or supports as needed, and better ways to streamline the process including the need for a rapid plan approval to be flagged at access.
NPRAG Next Meeting;
The NPRAG will meet online again on 28 May 2025.

Travel claiming rules, gap fees and other costs
Listen

Save page as PDF
23 July 2025
From 1 July 2025, there are new price limits for a range of NDIS services as detailed in the
2025-26 NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits
.
We are hearing from participants that therapy travel costs are draining their funding faster than expected. The updated travel claiming rules encourage more efficient scheduling by providers, create clear cost expectations for participants to help get better value from their funding, and ensures travel costs remain proportionate to the service provided.
We have listened to recent questions from participants and the disability community about these changes, including price limits for travel.
We know that changes can be confusing, and we’re committed to supporting you through these updates and will continue to share clear information.
We continue to focus on assisting participants to receive the supports they need. This includes regular monitoring of the market to ensure continuity of supports for participants.
More details are provided below to help you understand what’s changing and what it means for you.
Travel pricing for therapy providers
What has changed
From 1 July 2025, therapy providers can claim half of the relevant price limit for their time spent travelling, up to the usual time limit caps depending on location.
For example, a physiotherapist has a price limit of $183.99 per hour. From 1 July 2025, they are able to claim up to $92.00 per hour for travel, up to the relevant time cap according to their location.
This only applies to therapy providers. It does not apply to Disability Support Workers or other support providers.
What has not changed
Other travel rules have not changed.
All providers, including therapists, can continue to claim non-labour travel costs, such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of a vehicle i.e. fuel. They may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution towards these costs. This could, with the agreement of the participant, include costs such as the cost of flights and accommodation for travel to remote and/or very remote areas.
The NDIA uses the Modified Monash Model (MMM) to classify locations based on remoteness and population size, categorising them into MMM 1 (major cities) to MMM 7 (very remote). The NDIA modifies the classification of some locations to enable service delivery in isolated areas, making it more generous than the standard MM classification.
Therapy providers can keep claiming for travel time in both directions, up to the usual limits:
30 minutes each way in metro areas (MMM1–3)
60 minutes each way in regional areas (MMM4–5)
Travel in remote (MMM-6) and very remote (MMM-7) price limits are not subject to time limit caps. Remote and very remote loadings of 40% and 50% respectively remain unchanged.
It’s important that travel time and therapy time is shown separately on invoices.
Further information and examples of travel pricing can be found at
Annual pricing review.
Gap fees and other costs
Under NDIS rules, registered providers must not add any other charge to the cost of the supports they provide to any participant, such as ‘gap fees’, credit card surcharges, or any additional fees.
As registered providers, plan managers cannot pay invoices where the price is more the NDIS price limit. This rule applies regardless of whether the participant purchases the support from a registered or an unregistered provider.
Plan managers must work with providers – both registered and unregistered – to inform them they cannot make payment.
If a provider tries to charge these types of fees, it must be reported to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards commission.
Participants can contact the NDIS Contact Centre on 1800 800 110, while providers can call 1300 311 675 or email
[email protected]
with any questions.

Participant Safeguarding Co-design Working Group, meeting #6, 24 June 2025
Listen

29 July 2025
What we talked about
Topic 1: NDIA Gender Equity Strategy
The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) is currently developing a Gender Equity Strategy (the Strategy) to address gender disparities within the Scheme. According to the latest NDIS Quarterly Report, 38% of current participants in the Scheme are female, 1% are other, and 60% are male.
To ensure the Strategy is grounded in lived experience and expert insight, the NDIA is in the process of engaging with several stakeholders, including members of the Independent Advisory Council who identify as female, and Women With Disabilities Australia among others. The Agency is consulting with the Participant Safeguarding Co-design Working Group as part of these engagement activities.
Topic 2: Sector-led co-design approach update
Sector-led co-design activities have begun. People With Disability Australia (PWDA), Disability Advocacy Network Australia (DANA), Carers Australia and National Disability Services (NDS) are facilitating workshops with people with disability, families and carers, advocates and providers.
DANA is also partnering with others to reach key groups of participants. There has been a positive response to the workshops. We have heard participants feel safe and empowered to speak, appreciate conversations are led by trusted organisations and that emotional support is being provided as needed by professionals.
Topic 3: Looking back, looking forward
The co-chair facilitated a reflective conversation on how the group is tracking and what we are working on together. The group discussed what would follow the sector-led co-design activities and how they might guide future opportunities for co-design and consultation.
What we heard
NDIA Gender Equity Strategy
It is important for women with a disability to be empowered and supported to share their experiences themselves and to be heard independently of others.
The lives of women with a disability are shaped by a range of changing circumstances over time, which can impact their safety and wellbeing.
Alongside the Gender Equity Strategy, members wanted to know more about the pathways linking the NDIA and other services that support women including family and domestic violence and homelessness supports.
Sector-led co-design approach
People use the term ‘carer’ in different ways, and there were mixed views about how it should be used when planning co-design workshops for specific groups. The working group committed to talking through the words and terms being used as part of the co-design to ensure clarity and consistency in meaning across diverse groups.
Tailored co-design workshops with specific cohorts can help to build trust and allow for open, honest conversations about safety. However, it is important to ensure that the perspectives of providers and families are appropriately balanced with those of participants.
Insights from the initial round of targeted co-design activities will inform the working groups approach to incorporating diverse perspectives and bringing a range of cohorts together in future.
What we agreed on
The Commission will share resources and tools they have developed around gender-based violence, including a quality-of-life tool, with the NDIA.
A draft strategy consultation paper for the NDIA Gender Equity Strategy will be released later this year and shared with the group.
At the next meeting the group will further discuss how they might guide future opportunities for co-design and consultation.
NDIA will provide links to new NDIS Scheme Reform Co-design Working Groups website pages to Working Group members.
What we will do next
The Working Group will meet again on Tuesday, 22 July 2025, from 2-4pm (Australian Eastern Standard Time).
Who we met with
Participants, Disability Representative and Carer Organisations, Independent Advisory Council and Reference Group members, subject matter experts and NDIA staff.

30 July 2025
This statement provides an update on a cyber incident that occurred in April 2023 involving the unauthorised access of personal information held by HWL Ebsworth in relation to certain NDIS participants, prospective participants, their families and carers, and staff who were involved with NDIA legal matters represented by HWL Ebsworth. This statement does not relate to a new or different event.
Why are we publishing this statement?
The NDIA has an obligation under the
Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)
to notify any individuals potentially impacted by this cyber incident. The NDIA has notified all affected individuals who it has been able to identify and for whom the NDIA holds current contact details.
However, the NDIA has been unable to notify some individuals because it has either not been able to identify them or the NDIA does not hold their current contact details. These individuals are not NDIS participants but may be either a former participant, or related to a current NDIS participant, or someone who had previously applied for access to the NDIS.
The information about these individuals that was disclosed during the cyber incident involved details such as:
Name
Signature
Date of birth
Phone number
Address
Email address
Health information
Disability information
Medical records/Medical reports
Employment details
Bank details
We would also like to reassure everyone that this will not impact any participant's ability to receive services and that participants can continue to receive their disability supports in the usual way.
The NDIA is continuing to actively monitor and investigate the cyber incident.
The NDIA recognises that news of the cyber incident may be distressing and concerning for participants, families, carers and supporters. We sincerely apologise for this.
What can you do?
If you suspect that you or someone you know falls within the category of persons identified above, we recommend you take, or advise the person you know to take, the following actions to help reduce the risk of harm associated with the unauthorised disclosure of personal information:
Stay alert to increased scam activity, particularly email and SMS or telephone phishing scams. Contact
Scamwatch
for information about how to recognise, avoid and report scams.
The NDIA will never ask participants or their representatives for personal details by SMS. Do not click on any suspicious links or provide your passwords or any personal information to anyone you do not know. Always refuse any unprompted request from an individual to access your computer even if they say they are from a credible organisation.
Consider changing your online account passwords. The
Australian Cyber Security Centre
has guides on good password practices.
Enable multi-factor authentication for your accounts where possible. This means using extra checks to prove your identity.
Install up-to-date anti-virus software on any devices you use to access your online accounts.
Monitor your bank account transactions and check your credit report to see if it has any unauthorised loans or applications.
The
Office of the Australian Information Commissioner
has general information about how to respond following a data breach. It also has information on ways to protect your privacy.
Further information about the actions you can take to reduce the risk of harm from a data breach can be found on our website at the
Protecting your personal information after a data breach
webpage.
There is no need to contact us. However, if you wish to contact us about this incident, please contact us at 1300 216 807 (Monday to Friday, 9:00am to 6:00 pm AEST) or
[email protected]
.

1 August 2025
The NDIS recognises the passing of Gavin Burner, a valued member of the Independent Advisory Council (IAC). He was also the Co-Chair of the Intellectual Disability Reference Group.
Gavin was a strong advocate for people with disability, with a focus on rural and remote areas. Gavin will have a long-lasting impact on the NDIS.
Anyone who had an interaction with Gavin benefited. His wisdom and dedication to making the NDIS better was humbling.
Gavin believed in chasing your dreams and living a better life.
We will miss his input to the IAC and the NDIS.
Our heartfelt thoughts and best wishes are extended to Gavin’s family and friends during this time.

Many government services provide supports to people with disability, including:
the NDIS
state, territory and Commonwealth Government services like health, education, justice and transport.
All areas work together so people with disability receive support to meet their individual needs.
Access to mainstream services, community based activities and other government programs is a shared responsibility across many services.
The NDIA and governments work together through the Disability Reform Ministers’ Meeting to resolve any issues where their services interact.
A key tool is the
Applied Principles and Tables of Support (APTOS)
. APTOS outlines the roles and responsibilities of different sectors that deliver supports to people with disability.
Planners and partners escalate urgent issues raised by participants, carers or providers relating to accessing immediate and vital supports.
In response, the NDIA and state and territory governments work together to resolve any issues on a case-by-case basis.
Our Guidelines: how we make decisions
Updated information about what we consider when we make decisions under the NDIS is available in
Our Guidelines
.
The Mainstream and community supports guideline makes it easier to understand current guidelines on whether the NDIS or another government support system should fund participant supports. The guideline is based on the NDIS Legislation and Rules, existing guidance, policies and government agreements.

Mainstream and community supports interfaces (PDF 371KB)

Our updated guidelines make the NDIS more transparent, clearer and easier to understand. You can read more about this in the
Participant Service Charter

Strengthening provider access to NDIS systems

8 August 2025
Transition from Provider Digital Access (PRODA) to Digital ID (myID) and Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM)
To better protect participant data and ensure only the right people access NDIS systems, we’re making important changes to strengthen how we verify the identity of providers and their employees.
What you need to do now
Providers and employees accessing NDIS systems must complete the following steps. All steps can be done now, and we encourage you to complete these actions as soon as possible to maintain access to our provider portals.
Understand identity requirements
Employees will need at least a ‘Standard’ identity strength to access our NDIS provider portals via RAM.
Principal authorities (e.g. business owners or sole traders) will require a ‘Strong’ identity strength to link their myID to the business in RAM. This identity level requires you to hold an Australian passport (valid or expired within 3 years).
If you are a principal authority and you don’t have an Australian passport, check first whether another principal authority can link the business and authorise you.
If you are still unable to achieve a ‘Strong’ identity strength to link the business, set up your myID to a ‘Standard’ identity strength and contact the
RAM support line
for assistance.
More information about identity documents required to obtain ‘Standard’ and ‘Strong’ identity strength can be found here:
How to set up myID
Set up a personal myID (everyone)
Your myID is linked to your personal identity, not your organisation, and can be used across other Australian Government services and platforms. For this reason, you should use a personal email address to set up myID, rather than a work email address.
Link the provider organisation in RAM (principal authorities only)
Principal authorities must connect their myID to the business ABN in RAM.
More information about how to link your business can be found here:
Principal authority
.
Authorise your employees and representatives in RAM (principal authorities only)
The principal authority needs to authorise employees and business representatives to access NDIS provider portals and act on behalf of your business in RAM.
Once the principal authority sets up authorised administrators, both the principal authority and authorised administrator can send authorisations.
Learn more here:
set up authorisations
.
Accept authorisation requests (everyone)
If you are an authorised employee, you will receive an email authorisation request from the provider you work for with instructions on how to accept the authorisation. More information on how to accept the authorisation can be found here:
Accept an authorisation
Once you have completed these steps, you can access NDIS provider portals on behalf of the business.
Claim processes
There are no changes to how you make claims. All the functionality in the provider portals remains unchanged.
NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission (NQSC)
The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission (NQSC) will be moving from PRODA to RAM in December 2025.
The Commission’s transition is separate to the NDIA’s transition, and you should contact the Commission if you have further enquiries.
Sign up to the NQSC newsletter
to stay informed.

The Neurodegenerative Palliative Care and Rare Diseases Advisory Group (NPRAG) met for the second time on 23 July 2024. The meeting was held online and chaired by Prue Coroneos, General Manager, Policy Evidence and Practice Leadership at the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA).

Members of the NDIA’s Scheme Eligibility Branch gave a presentation to the group regarding early intervention. This included the current approaches and processes in place to support people with neurodegenerative and rare diseases and those experiencing palliative care.
Following the presentation, members discussed:
What early intervention means for people with neurodegenerative and rare diseases and those experiencing palliative care.
The main issues NDIS planners need to know about.
The experience and support people need from the NDIS.
Members provided advice regarding the ways the NDIA requests and considers evidence to support access and planning decisions. This included considerations for:
Priority access pathways.
The issues people with fluctuating conditions experience when engaging with the NDIS related to criteria and rules.
The need to further clarify what early intervention means for people with certain conditions.
The additional considerations and sensitivities required to understand children with degenerative conditions.

Stronger NDIS improving the lives of participants

15 August 2025
The National Disability Insurance Scheme is now supporting more than 739,000 Australians and their families.
The latest Quarterly Report by the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) shows how the Scheme is helping sustainably improve the lives of participants, including by more than doubling the number of NDIS participants in work, aged 15-24 years.
The quarterly report also shows growth in costs has slowed, despite an additional 26,500 participants entering the scheme over the past quarter (June 2025).
The annual rate of growth sits at just over 10%, down from 12% projected in the NDIA’s Annual Financial Sustainability Report (AFSR) in June 2024.
This shows that the NDIS is making good progress towards the target set by National Cabinet to reduce annual cost growth to 8% by 1 July 2026.
The quality of relationships, community participation, daily living and all other domains has also improved across every age group.
81% of participants aged 15 and over report having greater choice and control in their lives, up from 67%.
Participation rates peak between the ages of 5-7, with 16% of boys and 7% of girls aged 6 in Australia now on the NDIS.
Find out more in the
Quarterly Report
.
Jenny McAllister, Minister for the NDIS said "the NDIS’s most important job is to give people with a disability the freedom to be more involved in Australian society.
"People with a disability have the right to have choice and control over their daily lives, the NDIS continues to deliver this and that’s great news for all Australians.
“Scheme growth is declining. That’s good news. We are getting closer towards the 8 per cent target, but we know there is more work to be done to reform the NDIS and make sure it is set up properly for the long term.
“The key takeaway here is that the government is delivering on its commitment to ensuring high-quality supports for Australians with disability but as the Independent NDIS Review found, the NDIS needs a broader ecosystem of disability supports outside the scheme to make sure it is sustainable for the long term.
“The Government is committed to working with states and territories to design and deliver foundational supports to meet the needs of all Australians with a disability. This is work which our government will do in partnership with people with disability and the disability community.”

What is a public interest disclosure?
Current and former public officials can raise concerns about wrongdoing in the Commonwealth public sector under the
Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013
(PID Act). A concern raised under the PID Act is a ‘public interest disclosure’ or ‘PID’.
How can public officials make public interest disclosures?
At the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), public officials can make PIDs to their supervisor or to one of the NDIA’s authorised officers.
The people listed below are authorised officers at the NDIA:
Amity Durham
Janine Mohamed
Penelope McKay
Matthew Swainson
John Dardo
Samuel Porter, and
David Gifford.
Public officials can make a PID about the NDIA:
in person to their supervisor or to one of the NDIA’s authorised officers,
by emailing
[email protected]
, or
verbally by calling +61 2 6233 9200 and leaving a voice message.
Where can I find more information?
Public officials can read more about PIDs at the NDIA in the NDIA’s Procedures for dealing with Public Interest Disclosures.

The NDIS is Australia’s first national Scheme for people with disability. It provides funding directly to individuals.
We’re introducing a new computer system and some improvements to the way we deliver the NDIS. Find out about
what we're doing next.
What is the NDIS?
There are around 4.3 million Australians who have a disability. Within the next five years the NDIS will provide an estimated 500,000 Australians who have
permanent and significant disability with funding for supports and services. For many people, it will be the first time they receive the disability support they need.
What is the NDIS?
Am I eligible?
Answer some simple questions to see if you may be able to apply for the NDIS. These questions are just a guide, the final decision about eligibility is up to the NDIA.
Eligibility checklist
How do I apply?
If you think you are eligible for the NDIS, you can:
contact your local NDIS Office or local NDIS partner and ask them to support you to connect with local disability supports or apply to the NDIS if eligible.
phone the NDIS on 1800 800 110 to be supported to apply to the NDIS.
If you do not have access to a partner in your area, we recommend you contact the National Contact Centre on 1800 800 110 to be supported to apply to the NDIS.
Applying for the NDIS
If you are eligible for the NDIS and have received an ‘access decision’ letter, the next step is creating your NDIS plan.
Creating your plan
Your plan is a written agreement worked out with you. Everyone's plan is different. We will ask questions about how you are going in different areas of your life, what goals you would like to pursue and what kind of help and support you need. This will help us to develop a plan that provides the right support for you.
Creating your plan
Using your plan
Once you have your plan, there are people who will help you start it. Find out the different types of budgets, and how to use the myplace portal.
Using your plan
Changing your plan
Your plan reassessment is the opportunity to check your supports are working for you and they are helping you pursue your goals.

To join the NDIS you need to meet access requirements
This includes  your age, your residency status and the nature of your disability.
Am I eligible?
If want to learn more about disability supports, including the NDIS, you can:
find out more about
disability supports
on our website
call us on 1800 800 110
connect with an
NDIS partner
.
If you contact us directly, we will connect you with an NDIS partner. If you are over 9 you will connect with a
local area coordinator
. For children younger than 9, you will be connected to an
early childhood partner
.
If you are in a remote or very remote area, live in an area without an NDIS partner, have complex support needs, or are in a
hospital
or
justice
setting, we will refer you to a person at the NDIA.
NDIS partners can help all people with disability, including NDIS participants, their families and carers to find the supports you need to be more independent and do more of the things you enjoy in your local area.
Community connections
Your NDIS partner can work with you to develop a
community connections plan
if you want one, even if you are not eligible for the NDIS.
Community connections are all about helping you find the supports you need in your local community. These supports are called
mainstream and community supports
.
Mainstream supports are the supports from other government funded services, like health, mental health and education.
Community supports are supports you can get through community organisations, like peer-to-peer and community-based groups, religious groups, and services from local councils.
Learning about and connecting with community supports generally happens over one or two meetings. For some people it may be a regular conversation they have with their NDIS partner. There is no limit to the number of times you can contact your NDIS partner.
Checking your identity
Your NDIS partner will ask for documents to
check your identity
when you first meet with them.
Checking your identity is one of the ways that we protect your privacy, by making sure we only discuss your information with the right people.
Your NDIS partner will also ask to check your identity documents if you are a child representative, nominee, or authorised representative.
Applying to the NDIS
If you think you are
eligible
and want to apply to become an NDIS participant, there are different ways to complete your NDIS application. You can choose the way that best suits you.
You can:
visit your local area coordinator or early childhood partner.
Your NDIS partner
can talk to you about the
evidence
we need and help you complete your application
download and complete the
NDIS Access Request Form (PDF 1MB)
on your computer and email it to
[email protected]

download the
NDIS Access Request Form (PDF 1MB)
on your computer, print it out, and mail it to PO Box 700, Canberra, ACT 2601 with
supporting information (PDF 244KB)
contact the NDIA on 1800 800 110 and ask us for an
NDIS Access Request Form (PDF 1MB)
. We can mail or email it to you

NDIS office
and ask for a copy of the
NDIS Access Request Form (PDF 1MB)
. They can print it out for you, and you can email or mail it to us with
supporting information (PDF 244KB)
.

Your NDIS partner will make a time to go over your application and supporting evidence with you.
You can find more resources about applying to the NDIS in accessible formats on the
booklets and factsheets page
.

Reasonable and necessary supports
The NDIS funds a range of supports and services which may include education, employment, social participation, independence, living arrangements and health and wellbeing.
In order to be considered reasonable and necessary, a support or service:
must be related to a participant’s disability
must not include day-to-day living costs not related to your disability support needs, such as groceries
should represent value for money
must be likely to be effective and work for the participant, and
should take into account support given to you by other government services, your family, carers, networks and the community.
Transcript for '
Reasonable and Necessary supports
'
A participant's reasonable and necessary supports take into account any informal supports already available to the individual (informal arrangements that are part of family life or natural connections with friends and community services) as well as other formal supports, such as health and education.
These supports will help participants to:
pursue their goals, objectives and aspirations
increase their independence
increase community and workplace participation, and
develop their capacity to actively take part in the community.
How does the NDIA work out what is reasonable and necessary?
The NDIA makes decisions based on the
National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 (NDIS Act)
and the rules made under the NDIS Act.
When the NDIA makes decisions about which supports would be reasonable and necessary for a particular participant, we refer to the particular operational guideline that relates to each specific support.
Our Guideline
Download the guideline for Reasonable and Necessary Supports:
Reasonable and Necessary Supports (PDF 314KB)
Reasonable and Necessary Supports (DOCX 106KB)
Our guidelines
also provide practical guidance for decision makers.

Supports funded by the NDIS
Listen

The NDIS provides funding to eligible people based on their individual needs.
What is an NDIS support?
We fund NDIS supports that relate to your disability. NDIS supports are the services, items, and equipment that can be funded by the NDIS.
Being an NDIS support is only one part of the NDIS funding criteria. Supports need to meet ALL the
NDIS funding criteria
before we can include them in your plan.
NDIS supports lists now available
From 3 October, participants will only be able to use their NDIS funds for items listed as approved supports. There is also a list of things NDIS funding cannot be used for. In some circumstances participants may be able to request a substitution from the replacement support list.
View the NDIS supports lists.

There are some kinds of supports that will not be funded or provided by the NDIS
The NDIS Act and the rules made under the NDIS Act also tell us which supports will not be funded by the NDIS.
The NDIS can’t fund:
supports that are not NDIS supports. This includes supports that relate to your day-to-day living costs, are illegal, or should be funded by another government system or community service.
supports that include sexual services and sex work, alcohol or drugs.
View the list of supports that are not NDIS supports.
Our Guidelines: how we make decisions
Updated information about what we consider when we make decisions under the NDIS is available in
Our Guidelines.
The guidelines are based on the NDIS Legislation and Rules. They explain what we need to consider and how we make decisions based on the legislation.
The updated guidelines make the NDIS more transparent, clearer and easier to understand. You can read more about this in the
Participant Service Charter.

Senate Order 12 for Indexed List of Departmental or Agency files
Listen
Print this page
Save page as PDF
Every six months, the NDIA is required to prepare a response to the Senate Order 12 for Indexed List of Departmental or Agency Files. This is part of the government's ongoing commitment to give Australians greater access to relevant government information quickly and easily.
The report known more often as ‘the Harradine Report’ was first instigated by then Senator Harradine in 1996. The original Senate Order was amended in 1998. The
Senate Order 12 for Indexed Lists of Departmental and Agency Files
on the Parliament of Australia website now requires departments and agencies to provide an indexed list of the titles of all relevant files on their websites.
The lists are tabled twice a year in:
Spring sittings an indexed list of files is created for the preceding July to December period; and
Autumn sittings an indexed list of files is created for the preceding January to June period.
The NDIA's Indexed List of Files
In accordance with the Order, the Agency's list of files does not include files transferred to the National Archives of Australia, files essentially related to the internal administration of the Agency (staff or personnel, accounts, training, or general administrative matters) and case related files (for example personal representation or dealing with the personal affairs of an Agency client).
In addition, the Agency’s list of files does not include files with titles that would disclose the deliberations of Cabinet.

2 - Renewing your registration
As of 1 December 2020, all NDIS providers must register through the
NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission
(NDIS Commission). This includes the registration of new NDIS service providers, and the renewal of existing NDIS registrations.
If you have registered with the NDIS Commission, you will also need access to the NDIS myplace portal to connect to participants who have their NDIS plan funds managed by the Agency, create service bookings and submit payment requests.
To access the myplace portal, you will need a Digital ID with myID and Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM) account. The
myplace provider portal and resources
page has a step-by-step guide to help you set up a Digital ID and RAM.
New providers
The NDIS Commission regulates the NDIS market, provides national consistency, promotes safety and quality services, resolves problems and identifies areas for improvement.
Registration as an NDIS provider is done through the
NDIS Commission website
.
Renewing your registration
See the
NDIS Commission’s website
for further details.

How you get paid depends on how the participant manages their NDIS budget.
Self-managed participants
Participants who are self-managing their plan are invoiced by, and pay, providers directly.
Participants need a receipt from the provider to acquit the expenditure against their plan using the myplace participant portal.
Plan-managed participants
Where a participant has a plan manager assisting them, providers need to send invoices directly to the participant's plan manager. Invoices must include a valid ABN unless the provider is exempt from quoting an ABN.
The plan manager will process the payment through the myplace provider portal and pay the provider.
NDIA-managed participants
Registered providers need to submit a payment request through the myplace provider portal to receive payment for services or supports for participants who are NDIA-managed.
Refer to the
Using the myplace provider portal step-by-step guides
for detailed steps on making payment requests.
Providers need to submit a payment request within 90 days from the end of the service booking.
You will need the following information to claim:
participant name
participant reference number or NDIS number
dates of support
support item reference number
support item price.
Payment Terms
The NDIA is committed to making sure every dollar invested in the NDIS helps participants to make the most of their lives.
Valid claims will generally be paid within 2 to 3 business days.
For example, if you submit a valid claim on Monday up to 12 midnight, generally it will be processed into your bank account by Wednesday.
If you submit a valid claim on Friday, Saturday or Sunday up to 12 midnight, generally it will be paid by Tuesday.
In some circumstances if the provider is not recorded as a My provider it can take up to 10 days to be paid. Find out more about how NDIA’s new computer system and my providers.
We’re taking more time to check all claims submitted to ensure they are valid and that payments are going to the right support providers and equipment suppliers.
Pre-payment claim reviews
Some claims will be reviewed before we process payment.
If we decide to review a claim, we will send the provider an email that:
notifies that the claim has been placed on hold
requests further information
provides a fact sheet with instructions on how to identify the status of held claims.
When we receive the right information, and the claim is validated, we will add the claim to the next payment run.
We will send an email notifying the provider:
the claim has been released
when to expect payment
that remittance advice will be updated.
If the information is not satisfactory or if we receive no response, the claim will stay on hold until we receive the information necessary to validate the claim.
If a claim is not compliant, it will be rejected and not be paid. We will email the provider advising that the claim has been rejected and the reasons why.
Re-submitting a claim that has been held for review is non-compliant behaviour. Duplicate claiming it will not help you get paid faster, instead it will trigger a deeper review.
If a claim within a bulk upload is being reviewed, only the claim under review will be held. All other claims will be paid according to NDIA payment terms.
What you will see in the provider portal
You can review your payment request status via the provider portal.
If your payment request is in review it will have a “Pending Payment” status while we review the payment.
When the review is finished the payment status is updated. Payments and cancellations will appear on the remittance advice.
If a payment is being held for review, providers will always be contacted via email.
It is important to note that “Pending Payment” status does not mean that payment will be made. When a claim has been approved for payment the status will updated to “Paid”.
More information is available in the
myplace portal guide.
Registered providers should use the provider portal to submit all claims.
Providers are encouraged to contact us if they experience any difficulties lodging their claims online.
The manual claim form below should only be used by registered providers who are unable to submit a claim via the provider portal or a claim and payment enquiry.
Claims submitted using this form will take longer to process than claims submitted through our app or portals, and evidence must be provided to support each claim.
Download the manual form:
Provider Claim Form (DOCX 48KB)
Provider Claim Form (PDF 129KB)
Compliance monitoring
As part of our compliance monitoring, we may contact you to provide information about supports and/or services you have been paid for.
Unsupported claims may need to be repaid to the NDIA or referred to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, which could result in revocation of your registered provider status.
Providers concerned they may be in breach of, or at risk of breaching, their responsibilities should contact the NDIA by telephone on 1800 800 110.
For more information about compliance visit our
Provider compliance page.
The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission also has information and guidance on their website to help providers do the right thing including NDIS Practice Standards and the NDIS Code of Conduct.

The myplace provider portal is for registered providers to view and manage their services with a participant, including:
making payment requests for services provided to participants
managing and viewing details of agreements with participants
viewing registration details
instant messaging with participants.
The
my NDIS provider portal
, which is accessed by Specialist disability accommodation providers, allows providers to enrol and manage SDA dwellings.
Changing from PRODA to myID and RAM
Provider Digital Access (PRODA) is being replaced with myID and Relationship Authorisation Manager (RAM).
myID is the Australian Government’s Digital ID app used to verify your identity. RAM is an authorisation service that allows you to act on behalf of a business online when linked with your Digital ID. Providers need to transition to myID and RAM to access NDIS provider portals.
Setting up myID
Providers and their employees who access NDIS provider portals need to set up myID using a personal email address so they can continue to access the portals.
Logging in with another person’s credentials is not permitted. Each user must set up their own myID to access NDIS portals.
Learn more about how your personal information is used and protected when using myID.
myID only works on smart devices, such as smartphones or tablets. If you do not have access to a smart device, you will not be able to setup myID or log into the NDIS portals.
Providers who choose not to use the NDIS portals via myID can still connect with us through a
range of alternative channels
.
Find out about the
steps you need to take now, including how to set up your myID account and how to create, send and accept authorisations in RAM
.
New providers and new employees
As the transition to myID and RAM has now commenced, providers and their employees are no longer able to register a new PRODA account.
New provider organisations must set up myID and RAM to access NDIS provider portals, they cannot create a PRODA account.
If you are an existing provider onboarding new staff, the staff member needs to be set up with myID and linked to RAM to access NDIS provider portals.
Using PRODA during the transition
Provider organisations should aim to complete the transition as early as possible to ensure ongoing access to the provider portals.
The removal of access to the NDIS provider portals using PRODA is planned for late 2025.
Once an employee uses myID and RAM to access NDIS portals on behalf of an organisation, they will no longer be able to use PRODA to access NDIS portals on behalf of the same organisation.
However, their PRODA account will remain active to access other services.

myplace provider portal Terms and Conditions (PDF 93KB)
Assigning myplace access for other staff in my organisation
Providers nominate a Primary Contact who is responsible for approving myplace access requests for other users within their organisation.
We recommend nominating a Primary Contact before setting up myplace access or registering with the NDIS.
All myplace users need to have their own PRODA account and any additional users requiring myplace access need to be authenticated in PRODA.
If you are the Primary Contact within your organisation, you will receive a request to approve the additional user’s access once their PRODA account is authenticated and linked to myplace.
When you have approved the request, the additional user will be able to access myplace.
Change system access levels for staff in my organisation
Different levels of access are not available in myplace. All users with access to myplace are able to add and update information.
my NDIS provider portal step-by-step guide
All Specialist disability accommodation (SDA) dwellings must be enrolled with the NDIA through the my NDIS provider portal.
The my NDIS provider portal is separate from the myPlace provider portal where providers submit payment claims and create service bookings.
The my NDIS provider portal allows providers to create SDA dwelling enrolment requests online and to view and manage the end-to-end application process.
The my NDIS provider portal step-by-step guide describes how the my NDIS provider portal works with examples of the menus and screens in the portal.

Our Guideline
On this page:
1 - Working with a support coordinator
2 - Supported independent living information pack
3 - Our Guideline
Supported independent living is one type of support to help you live in your home.
It includes help or supervision with daily tasks, like personal care or cooking meals. It helps you live as independently as possible, while building your skills.
Supported independent living is for people with higher support needs, who need some level of help at home all the time.
Supported independent living is best suited to people with a disability who have higher support needs.
This means you need a significant amount of help throughout the day, 7 days a week. This includes overnight support.
You can get supported independent living if you live with other NDIS participants. You can also get supported independent living if you live on your own, but there might be other
home and living supports
that suit you better.
Supported independent living funding can’t be used for things like rent or other day-to-day expenses like groceries.
You can find more information by downloading and reading our
supported independent living guideline:
Further information on
supported independent living is available for providers
.
Working with a support coordinator
Participants who receive supported independent living also have funding for a support coordinator.
The support coordinator will help you find a provider to develop a roster of care submission with you. If you do not have funding for support coordination, you can look for providers using the
provider finder
.
Learn more about
who can help start your plan
.
Supported independent living information pack
The
SIL Easy Read Information Pack (PDF 1.7MB)
is available for participants. It includes information about how SIL works, planning, home and living support options, service agreements and support coordination.

4 - Our Guidelines
Home and living supports funded by the NDIS
The NDIS funds some home and living supports that may be required because of disability support needs. These include:
supports that build people's capacity to live independently in the community. This includes supports to improve living skills, money and household management, social and communication skills and behavioural management
home modifications to the participant's own home or a private rental property and on a case-by-case basis in social housing
support with personal care, such as assistance with showering and dressing where these are required
home help where the participant is unable to undertake these tasks due to their disability, such as assistance with cleaning and laundry
supports to assist you with finding and maintaining suitable housing
Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) in rare situations if you have an extreme functional impairment or very high support needs.
Supports funded by the NDIS must meet all other NDIS funding criteria before it can be included in a plan.
Other than specialist disability accommodation, we don’t generally fund housing. The housing and community infrastructure system is primarily responsible for housing and homelessness services.
Check out housing and community infrastructure for further information on responsibilities.
Examples of participants who may require home and living support include, but are not limited to:
Participants who have living arrangements that are no longer suitable for their disability-related needs.
Participants who have restricted or limited mobility and are limited by their accommodation and unable to carry out day to day activities or have difficulties accessing facilities e.g. bathroom, kitchen, toilet, inside and outside of their accommodation safely.
Participants who have a need for specialist home and living solutions to provide a basis for the provision of suitable care – for example an adult participant with complex behaviour support needs.
Participants who have somewhere to live, but their quality of life would be significantly improved by moving to alternative suitable accommodation or accessing additional support.
Participants who are currently in health care facilities who are unable to return to their pre admission accommodation setting safely when discharged from the health care facility.
Participants who are currently living in any other accommodation that is temporary, unsafe or unsuitable and mainstream services / community supports are unable to provide a suitable alternative due to the participants disability related needs.
Supports funded by housing and other systems:
Social and community housing. State and territory governments are responsible for social and affordable housing. Subject to waiting periods, state/territory government programs will support most people to find affordable housing in the general rental housing market.
Homelessness and emergency accommodation services
Commonwealth Rent Assistance, a payment through Services Australia (formerly the Department of Human Services) that assists eligible participants with the cost of housing
The National Rental Affordability Scheme (NRAS) that is creating additional affordable rental properties.
The NDIS may also contribute to the cost of accommodation in situations where the participant has a need for specialised housing due to their disability.

Assistive technology explained
Assistive technology is equipment or devices that help you do things you can’t do because of your disability.
Assistive technology may also help you do something more easily or safely.
All NDIS supports must meet the
reasonable and necessary
criteria.
We can’t fund AT items that are more appropriately funded by other government services.
For more detailed information on how we define and fund AT, or how to add AT into your plan, please refer to
our guideline
on assistive technology.
Understanding AT product risk
AT ranges from simple products to the complex systems. It is always a good idea to get advice from an AT advisor to determine the right AT solution for your needs. If the AT you are considering is higher risk AT (see below), then the NDIS requires you to get AT advice before getting that AT.
We use 2 product risk categories (‘low’ and ‘higher’) to assess the complexity of your AT needs.
Low risk AT products are:
unlikely to cause harm in day-to-day life
available for trial and / or can be purchased in retail stores
easy to set up and safely use without professional advice.
Higher risk AT products may be one or all of the following:
complex, such as a power wheelchair
known to have caused harm
used for a restrictive practice
require professional advice, setup or training for safe use.
Refer to the
Assistive technology product risk table
for a detailed explanation of different risk levels of AT that will help show the minimum level of advice and support when choosing AT you need.
Low, mid and high cost AT
We recommend you get advice from an AT assessor to make sure you get AT that's right for you.
It’s best to buy some items. For other items, it might be better to rent or borrow them. This is true if your needs are likely to change.
The
Assistive technology – Guide for minor trial and rental funding (DOCX 61KB)
has more information about how the NDIS works out the funding to include in your plan for minor trial or short term rental of AT. Some providers will also offer ’trial to buy’ arrangements.
The NDIA has different processes for low, mid and high cost AT. You can learn more about the categories and which part of your budget the funding sits in the
How do we consider the cost of the assistive technology
section of the guideline:
Low cost assistive technology: under $1,500 per item
Mid cost assistive technology: between $1,500 and $15,000 per item
High cost assistive technology: over $15,000 per item.
The
Assistive technology – Guide for low cost support funding (DOCX 71KB)
will help you understand how much funding you may need to buy low cost AT.
Mid cost AT
You don't need to provide us quotes for AT items under $15,000, but we still need
some evidence
(including a cost estimate) to make sure you get the right AT.
Only AT items valued over $15,000 will need a quote.
More information is in
Our Guideline - Assistive Technology

Additional features and other funding sources
You can use your own money or funding from other sources, such as Job Access, to buy additional features or access additional services which may not fall under reasonable and necessary supports in your NDIS plan.
If you require the same or similar AT for multiple purposes and locations you should discuss your needs with your planner, local area coordinator or support coordinator.
Evidence of AT required and AT assessments
We need to understand your AT needs and how the right AT will help you pursue your goals. We’ll need different information from you depending on the cost and risk.
Some AT will need a qualified AT advisor to talk with you about your needs and situation to help you identify the most appropriate AT solution. The AT advisor may be an allied health practitioner, continence nurse, rehabilitation engineer, AT mentor or other qualified practitioner.
For AT costing more than $15,000, we require both an assessment by a professional AT advisor (sometimes called an AT assessor) and quote for the AT proposed.
If you have AT in your plan, you will also have at least $500 included in your Capacity Building Improved Daily Living - Budget to seek advice from an independent advisor about your AT requirements.
You can learn more about AT assessments and how we assess risk in
How can you get assistive technology in your plan?
The
Understanding assistive technology evidence, advice, assessments and quotes (DOCX 66KB)
also has information about the evidence you need to supply to get AT approved in your plan and what you need to do before you buy AT. Requests for AT funding should be submitted to
[email protected]
or can be made at your planning meeting.
Choosing an AT provider
NDIS participants can choose how they want to manage the funded supports in their plan.
Unless your plan indicates otherwise, you can choose the providers you want to deliver AT supports included in your plan.
You are generally able to use your NDIS funds to either:
buy the AT outright or
access the
AT through rental, loan, subscription or other arrangements
. This includes arrangements to access refurbished and reissued AT.
Make sure you understand your plan and supports before
choosing providers
.

On this page:
1 - Paid activities
2 - Payments
Participants make an important contribution to NDIS improvement projects. To recognise this contribution, the NDIA has a Participant Engagement Payment Policy.
The policy sets out the approved activities, who is eligible for payment, and the amount paid. This includes consideration of out-of-pocket expenses.
The policy applies to:
participants
carers
nominees
people with a disability
who are invited to take part in specific NDIS improvement activities.
The policy does not cover:
NDIA employees, contractors, partners or public service employees
family members of NDIA employees (unless the family member is an NDIS participant)
employees of a disability organisation
members of the NDIA Board or Independent Advisory Council.
Paid activities
Paid activities may include:
online or in person focus groups
one on one interviews
online or in person working groups
online or in person panels or forums as speakers
participating in training videos or materials
We will tell participants before the event if it is a paid activity.
Payments
The NDIS is one of the only government agencies to have a payment policy of this kind.
The payment rates for an individual’s time are:
$50 per hour for up to 5 hours (pro-rata)
$250 per day (5 to 8 hours)
In some circumstances, participants may receive out-of-pocket expenses to support their contribution. This must be approved prior to the activity.
Expenses might include transport, parking, meals, accessibility equipment or a support person/carer.
All expenses must be reasonable and necessary, and represent value for money.

About individualised living options
Individualised living options (ILO) is support to live the way that suits you. ILO funding does not pay for a house.
Using your ILO funding, you can:
explore different ways to live – with a host or housemate
design your supports to help you live the way you choose.
There are lots of choices with ILO. You can share your home with housemates or you might live in the home of a host.
The purpose of ILO is for you to live in a way that best suits you. Your ILO and the funding that meets the criteria will be specific to your needs and in one of the three bands for both stage 1 and stage 2.

What is an Individualised Living Option

What makes ILO different
ILO is designed just for you. ILO supports work with other funded supports and services you receive as well as the help you might get from informal supports like family, friends or community.
What is an individualised living option?
Individualised living option supports are added to your plan in two stages.
Stage 1 is all about exploring and designing the individualised living option supports you want and need. You’ll work out where you want to live, with who, what support you’ll need, and who you want to provide that support. At the end of this stage there will be a completed service proposal form.
Service proposal form (DOCX 87KB)
Stage 2 is to put those supports in place. The support depends on how and where you want to live, and what supports you need. This could include things we don’t fund, like the support you get from friends and family. You can change your individualised living option supports if your needs change. They’ll be designed to provide the safety, stability and flexibility you need.
ILO is not:
funding for where you live or home modifications
support for activities outside your home, such as work or study, playing sport or going out
an arrangement where you don’t get to choose who you live with
a program of set supports or services that don’t reflect your preferences or needs.
ILO participant scenarios

Getting started – process for getting ILO supports in your plan
Talk to your LAC or planner about exploring your home and living options.
If you have a goal to explore home and living options, we’ll start by getting some information from you. We’ll probably ask you to complete the Supporting evidence form – home and living and request a change to your plan. Find out more on the
Home and living supporting evidence form page
.
Based on the information you provide us, the NDIA will consider your request and if it meets the NDIS funding criteria, we’ll determine
how much support you need
to explore and design your ILO package. We’ll communicate with you through the plan reassessment process before it is approved and added to your plan. Funding for the ILO Exploration and Design stage can be self-managed, Agency managed or plan managed.
Choosing an ILO provider
ILO providers play a critical role in helping you set up your ILO arrangement.
When you are looking for a provider, you should think about if they:
understand your needs
listen to you
explain things clearly to you
help you to think about what home and support options might suit you
are someone you can work with
are flexible and willing to try something new or explore possibilities for your home and life.
are able to identify supports suited to you rather than offering or suggesting an existing service that might not be right
will work with you to help fix problems that might happen with your ILO arrangement.
There is no requirement for you to use the same provider to deliver both Stage 1 and Stage 2 of your ILO, however we strongly encourage that the provider of Stage 2 is involved in the preparation of the service proposal form.

Who can give me advice?
You can get help from:
your family or friends
people who have already done something similar
a support coordinator or provider that has experience in delivering ILOs
a capacity building or advocacy organisation.

The NDIA is committed to making sure no NDIS participant under 65 years (under 50 years for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples) lives in residential aged care unless there are exceptional circumstances.
The NDIA supports younger participants to have more choice and control over where and how they want to live.

Can I choose to enter or continue to live in residential aged care?
There may be exceptional circumstances where a participant under 65 years may enter, or choose to continue to live in, residential aged care.
As part of the Department of Health and Aged Care's aged care assessment process, your support coordinator and the NDIA will help you to explore other home and living options.
They will also support you to provide documented evidence of what was explored.
This is to make sure you have considered all available suitable home and living options to meet your care needs.
If you want to continue to live in residential aged care, the NDIS will continue to support you through your NDIS plan.
When and how can I explore other home and living options?
You can choose to explore other home and living options at any time.
To start exploring other home and living options, contact your support coordinator or the NDIS.
How do I move out of residential aged care?
The NDIA has a specialist YPIRAC team who can support you to explore alternative home and living options so you can continue to exercise choice and control over where and how you live, with the right funded supports.
If you want to move out of residential aged care, contact your support coordinator or NDIAs specialist YPIRAC team by emailing
[email protected]
.
The specialist YPIRAC team and your support coordinator will work with you to help you explore and connect you with the most suitable home and living option to help you move out of residential aged care with the right supports.
What are the different housing options that may be available?
There are different types of housing options available and depending on where you are located, these may include:
Options that are funded by the participants themselves
Private rental market
Private rentals may include opportunities listed in the newspaper, online, through real-estate agents and websites. It may also include sharing a home with others to reduce costs.
This option is self-funded by the participant.
Home ownership
Some participants may live in their own home, or look at purchasing a home.
This option is self-funded by the participant.
Options that may be funded by other non-NDIS programs
Public housing
This option is generally a longer term housing solution for people on lower incomes.
It is managed by state and territory governments, and there are usually long waiting lists.
Applications for public housing are submitted through local state or territory government offices, where rental contributions from an individual are approximately 25% of their household income.
This option is not funded by the NDIS, but may be supported through other non-NDIS programs.
Community housing
Community housing offers secure long-term and affordable housing options to individuals who may be disadvantaged in the private rental market.
It is managed by not-for-profit organisations, known as community housing organisations, such as The Salvation Army Australia or Community Housing Limited.
Generally, tenants pay similar rent to public housing tenants, which is around 25% of their household income, or the market rent for the property (whichever is lower).
In some community housing settings, there may be group sharing options, where tenants can have their own bedroom but share facilities like the bathroom, kitchen and laundry areas.
This option is not funded by the NDIS, but may be supported through other non-NDIS programs.
Shared equity
This is an option where the cost of purchasing the property is shared across different partnerships such as family, developers and housing co-operatives, etc.
Most state, territory and local governments support various housing initiatives to assist singles, couples or families with the costs associated with owning their own home.
This option is not funded by the NDIS, but may be supported through other non-NDIS programs.
Options that may be funded by the NDIS
Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA)
A housing option the NDIS may fund is SDA. This is specialised housing designed to support people with extreme functional impairment or very high support needs.
Usually this option is for participants who have very high mobility needs or have a disability that affects their ability to self care and make their own decisions.
SDA may include specialist designs for people with very high needs or may have a location or features that make it suitable for providing complex supports for independent living.
This option is funded by the NDIS.
What types of in-home supports could the NDIS fund?
Supported Independent Living
Supported independent living
(SIL) is an NDIS support to help you live in your home.
It includes help or supervision with daily tasks, like personal care or cooking meals.
It helps you live as independently as possible, while building your skills.
Supported independent living is for people with higher support needs and  who need some level of help at home all the time.
Individualised Living Options
An
Individualised Living Option
(ILO) is an NDIS support that lets you choose the home you live in and set up supports in the way that best suits you.
An ILO is a package of supports that can help you live how you want in the home environment you have chosen. It is not the home itself.
ILO supports let you work out how you want to live, where you live and who you live with.
There are lots of choices with ILO. You can share your home with friends or housemates or you might live in a host arrangement or on your own with tailored support
Personal Care Supports
You may also be able to access personal care supports to provide assistance with, or supervision of, daily personal activities like:
personal hygiene, including showering, bathing, oral hygiene, dressing and grooming
toileting, bladder and bowel management and menstrual care
eating and drinking
attending appointments
use of aids and appliances, hearing and communication devices
mobility and transferring, for example moving in and out of bed and on or off the toilet
application of splints, basic first aid due to injuries sustained as a result of a participant’s disability.
Talk to your support coordinator or NDIS planner for more information about
personal care supports
.
You can also visit the NDIS website for more information about
reasonable and necessary supports
.
What happens once I choose to move out of residential aged care?
The NDIA has a specialist YPIRAC team who can support you to explore alternative home and living options so you can continue to exercise choice and control over where and how you live, with the right funded supports.
When you decide to move out of residential aged care, contact your support coordinator or NDIAs specialist YPIRAC team by emailing
[email protected]
.
The specialist YPIRAC team and your support coordinator will work with you to help you explore and connect you with the most suitable home and living option to help you move out of residential aged care with the right supports.
While you explore your home and living options, the NDIA will continue to provide you with funded supports through your NDIS plan.
How long does it take to move out of residential aged care?
It can take some time to identify and source the right home and living option, depending on your needs and choices.
Some home and living options will need to be built or have changes made, so you can live independently with the right supports.
We will keep you informed about the progress of your home and living option so you are prepared and ready when it is time to move.
How can I avoid entering residential aged care?
If you are an NDIS participant under the age of 65, we are committed to helping you avoid entry into residential aged care.
Your support coordinator and NDIS planner can help you explore and connect with other home, living and community support options that may be available outside of residential aged care.
If you think you may be at risk of entering residential aged care, it is important you contact your support coordinator or NDIAs specialist YPIRAC team by emailing
[email protected]
..
The NDIA has a specialist YPIRAC team who can support you to explore alternative home and living options so you can continue to exercise choice and control over where and how you live, with the right funded supports.

Senior Executive Service (SES) Inclusion and Diversity Champions
The Agency has created SES Champion roles to boost inclusion for all diversity groups.
Champions sponsor, support and promote activities to improve visibility and acceptance for different diversity groups.
Champions help show strong leadership around inclusion and diversity.
The Agency has a Disability Champion, Indigenous Champion LGBTIQASB+ Champion and a CALD Champion. We will add more Champions as we create new inclusion plans.
Employee Networks
NDIA employee networks exist to create an open and inclusive workplace culture where diversity is acknowledged, respected and celebrated.
The Agency currently has four employee networks:
Employee Disability Network
First Nations Employee Network
LGBTIQASB+ Staff and Allies Network
Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) Staff Network
To learn more about the importance of these networks, and to understand why they are integral to the Agency, check out the video below:

Reasonable and necessary supports
Would we fund it

To help you understand how we make decisions about what the NDIS can fund, we have introduced the Would we fund it guide.
This guide tells you how NDIA planners make decisions about what the NDIS will and won’t fund.
Sometimes it can be hard to understand why the NDIS has decided not to fund your requested support. Or, you might think that decisions for you are different to someone else with the same or similar disability.
When we make a reasonable and necessary decision, it is based on many different things.
This includes your disability support needs, your living arrangements and support you get from your family, friends and carers.
These factors are individual to you and will be different to other people living with a same or similar disability.
Would we fund it lets you browse through commonly requested NDIS support items that we find cause the most confusion.
For each support item, we explain how we typically make “reasonable and necessary” decisions about them.
When working out whether a support is reasonable and necessary for you, we look at the information you give us against the NDIS Funding Criteria in the
Reasonable and Necessary Guideline.
This isn’t a complete list of supports that can or cannot be funded by the NDIS.
Instead, it focuses on the items you’ve told us you want to understand more, or items that often result in requests for a plan reassessment.
If you want to ask about a different item for your individual needs, get in touch with your NDIS contact.
Their names and contact details can be found on your plan.

Provider selection process
Continence Provider List
The refreshed Continence Provider List (CPL) has been published on 29 October 2024 to continue this initiative. Providers were required to meet a range of criteria and were evaluated by an evaluation team including a participant first member.
The providers listed on the new CPL have met the eligibility criteria and minimum requirements and will assist participants, their families and carers to get better access to:
transparent pricing and product information to support informed choice
compare continence products in one list, and giving them more confidence to choose products
a wider range of products and services
improved end-to-end customer service
access to clinical support/advice about products (assessment is not included)
affordable and timely delivery, including those in rural and remote geographical locations.

The Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) vacancy finder helps you search for accommodation vacancies that match your needs.
You can refine the search results using the filters on the left hand side bar. Search by building type, SDA design category, number of residents, price and more.
You can contact the providers who are advertising to discuss your needs. If SDA has been included in your plan, the SDA building type and location will usually need to align with your plan.
If you need help
finding SDA vacancies
or would like to discuss if a SDA vacancy is suitable for you, please talk to your planner, support coordinator or local area coordinator. You should check that the dwelling meets your needs before committing to a service agreement.
Not all available SDA vacancies are advertised on the SDA Finder. Speak to your planner or support coordinator if you are having trouble locating SDA in your area.
The information in the SDA Finder is subject to the
NDIA disclaimer
and is provided for your convenience only. The NDIA doesn’t endorse any third party platforms and there may be additional providers not listed.
You should seek appropriate independent advice that takes your circumstances into consideration and evaluate service offerings carefully. The NDIA doesn’t accept liability for any claims or losses arising directly or indirectly from services provided by third party platform providers.
For providers
To notify the NDIA of an SDA dwelling vacancy,
complete the online form
.
The details of your vacancy, including your ABN, will need to match your SDA dwelling enrolment information.  You will be given the option to list your vacancy in the SDA Finder.

What is specialist disability accommodation?
Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) is a range of housing designed for people with extreme functional impairment or very high support needs.
SDA dwellings have accessible features. It helps residents live more independently and allows other supports to be delivered better or more safely.
People who live in SDA usually share with a small number of other people.
You might also be able to live in SDA by yourself if that option best meets your disability support needs and situation.
SDA funding includes the cost of the home or building you live in.
You’ll still need to pay rent and other day to day living costs.
It doesn’t include the services or support you might get in your home that relate to your disability support needs.
Other than SDA, we don’t fund housing. Most participants will access housing in the private market by owning or renting, or through social housing.
If you need affordable housing or are at risk of homelessness, there are state or territory government programs that can help you.
Your local area coordinator or support coordinator, if you have one, can help you apply for state or territory housing or homelessness services.
Learn more about
housing options and the NDIS
.
Who is eligible for specialist disability accommodation?
Most participants don’t need to live in SDA. People who live in SDA need to live in specialised homes, usually with very high levels of person-to-person support.
If you have a home and living goal, we’ll help you explore what options are right for you.
We’ll start by getting you to complete the
Home and Living Supports Request Form
.
For more information about SDA eligibility and funding download and read the
SDA Operational Guideline
:
Specialist disability accommodation (PDF 339KB)
Specialist disability accommodation (DOCX 99KB)
SDA Design Standard
The SDA Design Standard outlines the requirements for all newly built specialist disability accommodation.
There are 4 categories of SDA design:
improved liveability
robust
fully accessible
high physical support.
SDA dwellings must also comply with Australian National Construction Code as well as state or territory building codes, standards and local planning laws.
These combined requirements are in place to ensure that you can safely access high quality, well maintained SDA that meets your needs.
For more information visit the
SDA Design Standard page
.
Finding SDA
If you’re looking for specialist disability accommodation, you can search for vacancies using the SDA Finder.
The SDA Finder is an interactive tool created and maintained by the NDIA to help you find accommodation to meet your needs.
You can search for a vacancy by location, building type and maximum price per person per year.
Search results give you more information about the SDA vacancy and contact details for the SDA provider.
Most available SDA vacancies are advertised on the SDA Finder. You should speak to your local area coordinator or support coordinator if you are having trouble locating SDA in your area.

The 2024-2025 Annual Pricing Review (APR) report is now available
Recommendations
Frequently Asked Questions
Therapy travel claiming examples and easy read formats
The NDIA has released the outcomes of the 2024-25 Annual Price Review (APR)
The NDIA is responsible for setting price limits for services delivered to NDIS participants. The 2025-26 price limits are included in the APR released.
In developing this year’s APR the NDIA has reviewed millions more therapy data points than ever before.
Adjusting Disability Support Worker Supports (DSW)-related supports in line with increases in minimum wage and Superannuation Guarantee.
Increasing price limits of Level 1 Support Coordination, nursing, other supports and psychologists in NSW, VIC, QLD and ACT.
Reducing price limits for some therapy supports, removal of the higher price loading in WA, SA, Tas and NT for physiotherapy and psychology, reducing amounts that can be claimed for travel costs for therapists, and the cessation of plan management set up fee and remote loadings.
The 2025-26 Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits (PAPL) and associated pricing addenda will be published shortly. All changes will be in effect from 1 July 2025.
The NDIA is also releasing the Independent Pricing Committee (IPC) review of NDIS pricing. The IPC was established in September 2024 to review the Agency’s approach to pricing and found that a more nuanced approach, with price differentiation, would create better outcomes for NDIS participants and providers.
The IPC Review will inform future reforms to pricing, with the NDIA committed to publishing a roadmap in the coming months outlining how future pricing reforms will be delivered.
You can read the:
Independent Pricing Committee Report here
The 2025-26 Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits (PAPL) and associated pricing addenda will be published shortly.
The 2024-2025 Annual Pricing Review (APR) report is now available
2024-25 Annual Pricing Review Report (PDF 4MB)
2024-25 Annual Pricing Review Report (DOCX 2.9MB)
Following this year’s APR, the recommendations are as follows:
NDIA Pricing Workplan
Recommendation 1:
The NDIA should commit to publishing a three-year work plan to implement key reforms arising from the Independent Pricing Committee’s Final Report. This work plan should outline a structured schedule for reviewing specific market segments, such as therapy supports and disability support worker-related supports, at defined intervals, rather than conducting a full Annual Pricing Review each year.
The work plan will serve as the primary mechanism for delivering pricing reform, allowing for targeted deep dives, piloting of differentiated pricing approaches, and consultation with stakeholders.
Recommendation 2:
The NDIA should reset the APR cycle by releasing future pricing recommendations earlier in the financial year, to support improved planning, and align with broader government planning and budget cycles. The timing of the next full pricing review will be determined based on the progress of reform initiatives and will be outlined in the NDIA Pricing Workplan.
For Nurses and Nursing Providers
Recommendation 3:
The NDIA should increase the price limits for nursing and other supports not covered by Disability Support Worker-related supports, Capital supports or otherwise covered in the APR, effective 1 July 2025. This adjustment should reflect the weighted movement in the Australian Bureau of Statistics Wage Price Index (Australia, total hourly rates of pay excluding bonuses) and the Australian Bureau of Statistics Consumer Price Index (All Groups, weighted average of eight capital cities) over the 12 months to the March Quarter immediately preceding the indexation data (with an 80/20 weighting).
For Disability Support Workers and Providers
Recommendation 4:
The NDIA should adjust the price limits for supports determined by the NDIS Disability Support Worker Cost Model, effective 1 July 2025. This adjustment should reflect changes in the minimum wage specified in the
Social, Community, Home Care, and Disability Services Industry Award 2010
, as determined by the Fair Work Commission’s Annual Wage Review, along with any increase in the Superannuation Guarantee.
For Therapy Providers
Recommendation 5:
The NDIA should review therapy pricing to assess whether current price limits and market settings remain appropriate for therapy types. This work will inform the development of differentiated pricing approaches consistent with the framework outlined by the IPC.
Recommendation 11:
The NDIA should present therapy support price limits in 10-minute increments, to encourage greater flexibility in session lengths and improve alignment between claimed time and services delivered. This will be applied as a linear adjustment to the price limit per 10 minutes claimed.
This change would apply alongside existing claiming rules for therapy supports.
Recommendation 12:
From 1 July 2025, the NDIA should reduce the rate and cap on provider travel claims for therapy supports, limiting the total claimable amount for labour time component, to no more than 50% of the applicable therapy 10-minute price limit on a pro rata basis.
This change would apply alongside existing claiming rules and thresholds for therapy supports, including time-based limits by remoteness area, and assist to ensure that travel claims remain proportionate to the service delivered.
For Physiotherapists
Recommendation 6:
The NDIA should remove the state and territory differentiated pricing arrangement for supports delivered by a Physiotherapists and Psychologists from 1 July 2025. The hourly price limits for Physiotherapists and Psychologists in Western Australia, South Australia, Northern Territory, and Tasmania should be aligned with the corresponding price limits in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Australian Capital Territory, establishing a national price limit from 1 July 2025.
In Financial Year 24-25 terms, the national price limit for supports delivered by a Psychologist would have been $222.99 per hour, and the national price limit for supports delivered by a Physiotherapist would have been $193.99 per hour.
Recommendation 8:
The NDIA should lower the price limit for supports delivered by a Physiotherapist by $10 to a new national price limit of $183.99 per hour on 1 July 2025. This decrease will apply uniformly across all jurisdictions, and when combined with the removal of jurisdictional loadings, will result in a net reduction in price limits of $40.06 for Physiotherapists in Western Australia, South Australia, Northern Territory, and Tasmania.
For Psychologists
Recommendation 6:
The NDIA should remove the state and territory differentiated pricing arrangement for supports delivered by a Physiotherapists and Psychologists from 1 July 2025. The hourly price limits for Physiotherapists and Psychologists in Western Australia, South Australia, Northern Territory, and Tasmania should be aligned with the corresponding price limits in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Australian Capital Territory, establishing a national price limit from 1 July 2025.
In Financial Year 24-25 terms, the national price limit for supports delivered by a Psychologist would have been $222.99 per hour, and the national price limit for supports delivered by a Physiotherapist would have been $193.99 per hour.
Recommendation 7:
The NDIA should increase the national price limit for supports delivered by a psychologist by $10 to a new national price limit of $232.99 per hour on 1 July 2025. This increase will apply uniformly across all jurisdictions and, when combined with the removal of jurisdictional loadings, will result in a net reduction in price limits of $11.23 for Psychologists in Western Australia, South Australia, Northern Territory, and Tasmania.
For Dietitians
Recommendation 9:
The NDIA should lower the price limit for supports delivered by a Dietitian by $5 to a new national price limit of $188.99 per hour on 1 July 2025.
For Podiatrists
Recommendation 10:
The NDIA should lower the price limit for supports delivered by a Podiatrist by $5 to a new national price limit of $188.99 per hour on 1 July 2025.
For Support Coordinators
Recommendation 13:
The NDIA should index the price limits for Level 1: Support Connection services and Psychosocial Recovery Coaches service in line with indexation of supports determined by the Disability Support Worker Cost Model in Recommendation 6 on 1 July 2025.
Recommendation 14:
The NDIA should maintain the existing price limits for Level 2: Coordination of Supports and Level 3: Specialist Support Coordination, in alignment with current NDIS reforms.
For Plan Managers
Recommendation 15:
The NDIA should maintain the current monthly fee for plan management. This applies to support item 14_034_0127_8_3 – Financial Administration of Plan Management, priced at $104.45 per month.
Recommendation 16:
The NDIA should remove the one-off establishment fee for plan management effective from 1 July 2025. This applies to support item 14_033_0127_8_3 – Set Up Costs for Plan Management, which is currently priced at $232.35.
Recommendation 17:
The NDIA should remove remote and very remote loadings for plan management, effective from 1 July 2025, and apply a consistent national price. This applies to support item 14_034_0127_8_3 Plan Management Monthly Fee.
Frequently Asked Questions
What do these changes mean for participants?
There is no change to participant plans as a result of price decreases.
When you get a new plan, it will be created at the revised rates.
It is important that participants do not pay NDIS premiums for certain therapies, while those same services are being delivered to other Australians at lower rates.
These changes will help ensure value for participants accessing supports and equality for participants around the nation. The NDIA believes the markets are strong enough that participants will still have access to the supports they need.
What do these changes mean for participants who use plan management supports?
For most participants, there will be no change in how they receive plan management supports. The monthly fee remains the same, and most plan managment is delivered virtually.
The removal of the establishment fee and remote loadings simplifies pricing and reflects how services are now delivered, consistently, at scale, regardless of location.
Will this see providers leave the market? What will you do if that happens?
As a market steward, the NDIA has a role in creating an efficient and diverse marketplace. This requires continually monitoring and reviewing price control frameworks and other market settings to ensure a fair and optimised market.
The NDIA will monitor the NDIS market to ensure continuity of supports for participants. We encourage any provider who has financial sustainability concerns to contact the NDIA to discuss their circumstances by emailing
[email protected]
What will this mean for plan managers?
Plan managers continue to play a vital role in the NDIS by assisting participants with financial management of their plans. The current reforms aim to enhance efficiency and value for participants, not to eliminate plan management services. The NDIA acknowledges the importance of plan managers and is working to integrate their services more effectively within the Scheme.
Remote and very remote loadings were introduced to address barriers to access in thin markets. What will happen to those participants?
Many plan managers, particularly larger plan managers, operate nationally and have been increasing their ability to support participants regardless of location. It is observed that plan management support is largely delivered virtually, even in remote and very remote areas. Removing the loadings supports a simpler, fairer pricing model that reflects actual service delivery and aligns with the NDIA’s pricing principles.
Concerns in thin markets are better addressed through other market stewardship mechanisms.
Price changes will take effect 1 July 2025, only a few weeks away. Why didn’t you give us more time?
The 2024-25 APR recommendations will take effect from 1 July 2025, ensuring alignment with the Fair Work Commission’s Annual Wage Review outcomes.
The NDIA is adjusting the APR timeline to improve implementation and provide earlier advice to the sector. From 2025-26, future APR’s will be delivered earlier in the year, with recommendations finalised and published well in advance of the financial year.
This change will take effect from the 2026-27 APR.
What does the publication of 10-minute increments mean in terms of claiming?
Displaying therapy price limits in 10-minute increments is intended to encourage greater flexibility in billing and service delivery. It aims to clarify that 1 hour is not a ‘default’ or ‘expected’ service length, and that the length of service can vary depending on the agreement between the participant and provider, based on individual needs and circumstances.
What does the change to therapy travel claiming rules mean for participants?
We are hearing from participants that therapy travel costs are draining their funding faster than expected. The updated travel claiming rules encourage more efficient scheduling by providers and provide clear cost expectations for participants to help them get better value from their funding.
Providers can still charge for non labour costs such as tolls and vehicle wear and tear, which remains unchanged.
Why is Support Coordination Level 1 being indexed but Level 2 and 3 are not?
The support coordination market continues to grow steadily over time. On balance, analyses this year show that supply continues to meet growing participant’s demand. The Agency is currently running a Support Coordination pilot to build a clearer understanding of what a quality support coordination looks like and to inform the future Navigator reform work.
Evidence from this work will support future pricing decisions into the future. It is expected the skills and experience of Support Coordinators will continue to play a key role in helping participants understand and implement supports in their plan. This role will be further refined as the Navigator reforms are co-designed and implemented.
Why are price limits for therapy being reduced and what informed the reduction?
In 2019, the NDIA introduced higher price limits for psychologists and physiotherapists in some states as a short-term measure to support market development
These premiums were not intended to be permanent and were to be reviewed once better data became available.
This year’s APR uses the most comprehensive set of external data to date by significantly expanding its data sources to include more than 10.5 million therapy transactions.
The NDIA used data gathered from four main sources – Medicare Benefits Schedule data (showing the full fee charged to patients, inclusive of both the government rebate and the patient’s co-payment), Private Health Insurance Claims Data from a major private health insurer, website listing data, and data from comparable government schemes.
Additionally, data shows the current NDIS price limits for physiotherapists, dieticians and podiatrists are higher than market rates for non-NDIS participants.
For example, the NDIS hourly price limit of $193.99 for Physiotherapy (or $224.62 in WA, SA, NT and TAS) is 22-29% above MBS and PHI benchmarks in eastern states, and up to 55-68% higher in WA, SA, NT, and TAS.
These comparative benchmarks are based on new, comprehensive billing datasets.
Aligning with broader market rates supports long-term sustainability and fairness for all participants. It ensures pricing decisions reflect actual market conditions.
What will the therapy pricing review consider?
The review will assess existing price limits and help guide the move from one-size-fits-all pricing towards the differentiated pricing approach outlined in the Independent Pricing Committee’s report. It will consider factors such as practitioner qualifications, workforce availability, service settings, regulatory obligations, and the nature of participant outcomes achieved. It will be informed by sector consultations and analysis of provider and market data. The review will ensure pricing continues to support participant outcomes, provider sustainability, and service quality.
What is differentiated pricing?
In late 2024, the Minister established an Independent Pricing Committee (IPC) to support the development of the Annual Pricing Review (APR) and provide recommendations to the NDIA Board.
To guide NDIS pricing approaches, the IPC offers a framework for classifying supports based on how they deliver benefits to participants and the nature of costs incurred by providers.
Differentiated pricing is different ways of pricing supports based on the benefits and costs to participants and providers.
It moves beyond the assumption that hourly pricing is always appropriate and instead introduces a more structured way to assess when different pricing approaches may be beneficial.
Can providers charge participants ‘gap’ or extra fees?
No. Registered providers are not allowed to charge participants out-of-pocket costs on the supports they provide. This includes costs like credit card surcharges, ‘gap’ fees or copayments.
Therapy travel claiming examples
Thomas lives in metropolitan NSW (Metropolitan - MMM1) and needs psychologist support through the NDIS.
A psychologist travels 30 minutes each way, a total of one hour travel, to see Thomas and provides a 1-hour session.
The psychologist can claim for 2 hours total. This includes:
1 hour for the therapy session at a price of $232.99.
Plus 1 hour at the travel rate, which is calculated at half the price of the therapy hourly cost. This price is $116.50.
The total fee is $349.49 ($232.99 + $116.50)
Providers may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution towards non-labour travel costs, such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of a vehicle i.e. fuel.
Eleanor lives in Colac, Victoria (Regional – MMM4) and needs psychologist support through the NDIS.
A psychologist travels 1 hour each way to see Eleanor and provides a 1-hour session.
The psychologist can claim for 3 hours total. This includes:
1 hour for the therapy session at a price of $232.99.
Plus 2 hours at the travel rate, which is calculated at half the price of the therapy hourly cost. This price is $116.50 per hour, $233 in total.
The total fee is $465.99 ($232.99 + $233)
Providers may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution towards non-labour travel costs, such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of a vehicle i.e. fuel.
Kelly lives in Beacon, WA (Remote – MMM6) and needs psychologist support through the NDIS.
A psychologist travels 3 hours each way to see Kelly and provides a 1-hour session.
Because Beacon is remote, there is no travel time limit cap applicable and the remote loading of 40% applies to the travel and the support cost.
The psychologist can claim for 7 hours total. This includes:
1 hour for the therapy session at a price of $326.19, including the remote loading.
Plus 6 hours travel which is calculated at half the price of the therapy hourly cost. This price is $163.10 per hour, including the remote loading.  The total travel cost is $978.57.
The total fee is $1,304.76 ($326.19 + $978.57)
Providers may negotiate with the participant for them to make a reasonable contribution towards non-labour travel costs, such as road tolls, parking fees and the running costs of a vehicle i.e. fuel. This could, with the agreement of the participant, include costs such as the cost of flights and accommodation for travel in remote areas.
Peter is a psychologist working in a capital city, and visits two NDIS participants in the same area (MMM1-3).
Both participants have agreed to cover travel time and travel costs. Peter drives to the first participant (45 mins), then to the second (25 mins), and finally back to the office (50 mins). Both participants agree to cover travel time and costs.
As Peter is travelling in a MMM 1-3 area, the time limit cap for travel is 30 minutes. This means he can claim up to 30 minutes each way per participant.
For the travel to the participants, which took 70 minutes in total, Peter can claim up to 30 minutes travel for each participant.
He can also claim 25 minutes return travel for each participant (half of the 50 minute trip back to the office).
For travel costs Peter can claim at half of the maximum hourly therapy rate of $232.99, which is $116.50 per hour of travel.
Non-labour related travel costs:
Peter drives 50 km total.
At $0.99/km, that’s $49.50, split evenly between the participants = $24.75 each.
Each participant is charged 55 minutes of travel time at $116.50/hour, plus an additional $24.75 for travel costs.

Frequently asked questions
What happens when I make a report?
We take all reports seriously and analyse every single one. Please report all suspicions of fraud.
The information you provide is kept confidential, and your rights are protected by law.
The more information you can provide at the early stages, the better able we are to investigate the matter.
After you make a report, you will receive a reference number. You do not need to make multiple reports for the same matter.
If you wish to provide further information about a matter previously reported, please complete the
online tip-off form
with your reference number. Alternatively, call the dedicated NDIS Fraud Reporting and Scams Helpline on 1800 650 717 and quote your reference number.
We may need to contact you for additional information. Please note, we cannot do so if your submission is anonymous.
If you choose to remain anonymous, please provide as much information as you can to assist us with investigations.
Will I be notified of the outcome?
We regularly share outcomes of fraud investigations and our work to improve integrity in the NDIS.
However, sometimes we can’t provide information on a matter because we need to protect the privacy of individuals or the integrity of an investigation.
We also may not be able to  provide any information about the conduct or outcome of a investigation due to our obligations under the Privacy Act 1988.
What actions does the NDIA take against non-compliance or criminal behaviour?
When deciding appropriate actions we consider the circumstances, attitudes, behaviours and activities of the person.
We know most people are trying to do the right thing, and we aim to promote this through education and support.
If the person has made a deliberate decision to do the wrong thing, we will take a stronger response.
If we find evidence of non-compliant behaviour, we may take action including:
conducting an audit
provide further education and guidance
reclaiming a debt
referring the matter to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission.
If we find evidence of criminal behaviour, we will investigate further and may make a referral to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to pursue criminal prosecution.
We may also take civil action to recover money lost as a result of fraud or intentional non-compliance.

About the early childhood approach
The age range is changing for the NDIS early childhood approach.
From 1 July 2023, the early childhood approach changed to include children younger than 9.
This change is being rolled out over the next 2 years.
Our early childhood approach is how we support children younger than 9 and their families.
The early childhood approach helps children younger than 6 with developmental delay or children younger than 9 with disability and their families to access the right support when they need it.
Children younger than 6 do not need a diagnosis to get support through the early childhood approach where there are concerns about their development.
The early childhood approach was developed based on evidence- based research with the help of leading experts in early childhood intervention.
The approach supports
best practice in early childhood intervention
because it helps the child and family to build their capacity and supports greater inclusion in community and every day settings, meaning each child will be provided with opportunities to grow and learn.
It is about giving children and their families the right supports to enable them to have the best possible start in life.
A child’s early years are very important as they set up how they will learn and develop later in life.
Our early childhood approach focusses on being both family-centred and strengths-based. We do this by acknowledging that as parents and carers you know your child best.
Families are at the centre of all services and supports.
Early childhood intervention should fit in as much as possible with your child and family’s daily activites.
To learn more about early childhood intervention, watch this
family perspectives video
.
Our early childhood approach aims to:
provide timely support to ensure that you are able to access the supports you need
give you information about best-practice early childhood intervention supports and how you can help your child
increase your confidence and capacity to manage and respond to your child’s support needs
increase your child’s ability to do activities they need or want to do throughout their day
increase your child’s inclusion and participation in mainstream and community settings like childcare or recreation
give you information about, and referrals to, other support services if needed, like parent support groups.
How the early childhood approach works
In many areas around Australia, early childhood partners are available to help you get the support your child needs through the early childhood approach. Early childhood partners are local organisations we fund to deliver the early childhood approach.
What if my child is older than 9?
The NDIS also supports children who are over 9 through our
local area coordination partners
.
An early childhood partner, Local area coordination partners will work with you to understand your child’s needs and connect you to mainstream and community supports in your area.
They can also help you see if the NDIS is right for your child.
Reviewing how we support young children and their families
The NDIA is implementing improvements to the way we are supporting young children and their families early, to reach their full potential.
Read the latest update on how we’re progressing with the ECEI reset.
Quality supports for children
If your child has NDIS funding for early childhood intervention, therapy supports or behaviour support, you want to know your provider uses quality practices.
We partnered with the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission to develop a guide to explain what quality practices do and don’t look like, and help you choose the right provider for you and your child.

quality supports for children
page to read the guide.

A participant’s SIL funding is not linked to a specific provider, existing service or a provider-determined support model.
Once the participant has an approved plan, providers can discuss the exact supports to be delivered within the approved funding and manage support delivery.
Participants will be notified in writing of their SIL funding decision.
If a participant is new to SIL or has had a change of circumstances that results in their SIL funding changing, the NDIA will communicate the participant’s funding decision to:
the SIL provider listed in the participant’s
roster of care
the participant’s support coordinator.
We will communicate the following information to the SIL provider and the support coordinator:
the annual funding value for irregular SIL supports
the annual funding value for the regular SIL plan
the total funding value for the SIL plan (category level amount)
the estimated funding value for weekly SIL supports (not including irregular support days).
This will include information on any variations from the roster of care submission.
We will notify the SIL provider as decisions are made. We will email the information to the SIL provider’s primary contact email in the provider’s record.
Providers can update their contact information via the
NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission.
In most circumstances we will continue funding an existing SIL participants’ SIL supports at the current value in their plan.
Where this is the case, providers should support participants to work within the approved budget.
Refer to the
Supported independent living operational guideline
for information on when participant SIL funding might need to change.
The NDIA will automatically adjust SIL funding to reflect any funding changes that materially impact on the participant’s SIL plan value, such as any indexation changes.
In some circumstances we may review SIL funding decisions outside a plan reassessment. This could be because an error has occurred or to ensure the amount of support remains reasonable and necessary.
The participant’s approved SIL funding may not match the total value in the provider’s proposed roster of care. The NDIA will explain funding decisions to the participant and their representatives.
This will occur during the planning conversation and will be detailed in the participant’s approved plan.
All participants who receive SIL are also funded for a support coordinator to help the participant implement their plan.
Their role includes discussing with providers the supports they are to deliver within the participant’s plan funding.
Under the NDIA Act, the NDIA cannot accept requests to review participant plans from providers. If a participant doesn’t agree with the decision we’ve made, they can ask for an internal review of our decision.
They’ll need to ask for an internal review within 3 months of getting their plan. Learn more about
reviewing our decisions
.
Providers must ensure that service bookings and payment requests align with the participant’s plan funding, the
NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits
and the
NDIS Code of Conduct
.
The NDIA acknowledges providers’ ongoing commitment to delivering high quality SIL supports. The NDIA continues to work with participants and providers to support improved outcomes for SIL participants.
We encourage providers to contact the NDIA’s provider engagement branch for information and ongoing advice about delivering SIL supports.
Automatic plan extensions
If a plan reassessment has not occurred by the time the participant’s current reassessment date, it will be automatically extended by 365 days.
An automatic plan extension also updates any existing SIL service bookings, to ensure support continuity for participants.
The duration and quantity of supports will reflect the new duration of the plan but will not reflect the original service booking in the plan.
To modify automatically extended service bookings to match the original plan, providers should update the unit price and quantity in service bookings. Learn more about
managing service bookings
.

The roster of care submission is considered with all other information outlined in the
Supported independent living operational guideline
.
Providers must consult with the participant, or their nominee, to compile the information included in the roster of care submission.
Providers must include sufficient detail in the roster of care template and tool to assist the NDIA to decide the reasonable and necessary support needs of the participant.
It is important to remember that the roster of care submission is only one piece of information the NDIA use to help determine the right amount of funding.
View the Guide to using the Provider SIL Roster of Care Tool for guidance on completing a roster of care.
When the Roster of Care is completed, providers can email it to
[email protected]
. They can also give it to the participant's support coordinator to submit with their home and living or reassessment request.
The Roster of Care should not be sent to
[email protected]
, this inbox is no longer monitored.
All provider enquiries about the roster of care submissions or supporting information should be emailed to
[email protected]
.
High intensity supports
A support is considered a high intensity support when a participant:
Requires frequent (at least 1 instance per shift) assistance is required to manage challenging behaviours that require intensive positive behaviour support; and/or
Requires assistance from a disability support worker who has one or more of the high intensity support skills specified in the
NDIS Commission’s NDIS Practice Standards: skills descriptors
.
If the participant requires high intensity supports, providers must include evidence to support this in the roster of care submission template. Evidence or supporting information can include:
reports or occupational therapy assessments
medical and allied health reports.
Reports must not be older than two years and should be from an independent service provider.
Overnight supports
SIL is suitable for people who need some level of overnight support.
If the participant needs up to two hours of awake support overnight, we will fund sleepover support.
If the participant needs more than two hours of awake support overnight, we fund active overnight support. Active overnights are where the support worker is awake during normal sleeping hours to support the participant because of their disability.
The
Supported independent living guideline
provides information on how we generally fund overnight supports.
Irregular SIL supports
Participants have separate funding in their plan for irregular SIL supports. Irregular supports are the supports needed for unexpected situations.
Irregular supports might be required if the participant becomes ill or their day program is cancelled and additional support is needed for a period that was not initially planned and rostered for.
The
Supported independent living guideline
provides information on how many days of irregular support we generally fund.
Refer to the claiming rules in the
NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits
and learn how to create a payment request for irregular SIL supports in the
myplace provider portal step-by-step guides
.
Programs of support
Providers of group-based supports like SIL can enter into a program of support agreement with the participant.
Please see the
NDIS Pricing Arrangements and Price Limits
for more information on programs of support.

The Participant Service Charter includes timeframes for our processes – set out under the Participant Service Guarantee.
The Participant Service Guarantee sets clear timeframes for key NDIS processes.
The NDIA must make decisions about access, plan approvals, plan reviews and nominee changes within these timeframes. This gives participants, families and carers greater certainty about how long processes will take.
Each quarter, the Agency reports against Participant Service Guarantee (PSG) timeframes in the
Quarterly Report
.
Performance against the PSG measures improved for 6 of the 10 PSG measures in the June 2025 quarter, with significant improvement for PSGs 2, 4 and 17 at over twenty-five percentage points. The improved performance has been achieved whilst workload continues at the high level achieved during the March 2025 quarter. Of the 10 measures, one is meeting PSG timeframes (PSG 7) and a further 3 have results over 80% (PSGs 6, 8 and 13).
We have taken considerable steps to improve both the participant experience and performance against the PSG measures. A key focus has been on reducing waiting times for participants awaiting their first plans or requesting a plan change. These improvements aim to align with community expectations and recent changes in legislation and policy
We expect further improvements in timeframes in the upcoming quarter. The focus will remain on access decisions, noting there is evidence of results for PSGs 2 and 4 improving.
The tables below show the timeframes for each of the key NDIS processes, which have been pulled from the latest Quarterly Report.

Note: The NDIA's new participant check-in process ensures that every scheduled reassessment begins with contact from the planner or partner to discuss reassessment options well before and scheduled reassessment date. Plans are extended automatically if they have not been reassessed before expiry so participants have continuity of support. That is, participants do not stop receiving supports.
†Excludes reassessments initiated prior to migrating service processes to the new computer system.

Our Guideline
More information
On this page:
1 - Justice Liaison Officers
2 - Justice panel
3 - Our Guideline
4 - More information
If you have a disability and you're involved in the justice system, you have the same rights as anyone to become or remain an NDIS participant.
We consider you're involved in the justice system if you are:
in custody in a correctional facility, for example a prison, remand centre, youth detention centre or secure mental health facility
on remand, awaiting or following sentencing
required by a court order to regularly report to a correctional or community correctional agency, for example on bail, probation or parole
serving a community based order, or are on a leave of absence order or therapeutic leave
under forensic orders, which may include restrictions on your movements or other requirements, such as drug testing or attending prescribed treatment.
The NDIS is responsible for providing disability-related supports to help meet your needs while you’re involved in the justice system.
State justice systems are responsible for:
imposing conditions on any individual, who may be considered a risk, while in the community
law enforcement and ensuring any participant released from a justice setting complies with any supervised orders or conditions that may be in place
taking action should someone re-offend or be considered a risk of re-offending
protecting other people if a participant has a known criminal history.
We have a guideline about the
justice system
, which explains what we consider and how we make decisions based on the legislation:
Justice Liaison Officers
The NDIA Justice Liaison Team has a network of Justice Liaison Officers (JLOs) who work collaboratively with state and territory government agencies to support people with disability in custody and to transition back into the community.
The JLOs can:
work with mainstream justice services to assist people with disability to access the NDIS
help people with disability access the supports they need while in custody and to transition back to the community
respond to enquiries and assist with any barriers between the NDIS and mainstream services
provide education and promote a best practice approach.
Supporting access
During the NDIS access process, JLOs can:
build capacity with stakeholders to understand NDIS access processes, including consent requirements
provide information and support for required documents
assist with access requests and monitor the status of applications, including prioritising requests
advise relevant stakeholders of the decision and provide guidance on the next steps
where access is met, support progression to the NDIS planning stage.
For applicants who are not eligible for the NDIS, JLOs can provide connection to Local Area Coordinators who can support access to appropriate community and mainstream supports.
Planning, implementation, monitoring and reassessment
JLOs support NDIS planning staff to support participants in custody and transition into the community, ensuring that all stages of the NDIS planning pathway occur at the right time.
JLOs work in collaboration with internal and external stakeholders, to ensure a participant’s NDIS plan meets their disability-related needs.
Justice panel
While disability supports may be crucial in reducing the risk of re-offending, the NDIS is designed to only fund disability-related supports.
Criminal matters, including post-release supervision, remain a matter for state judicial systems.
In some instances, the line between the two systems has become blurred. There needs to be greater accountability in place to ensure the NDIS is not replacing justice supports.
The NDIS justice panel examines the management of prisoners exiting jails who have been identified as current or potential participants in the NDIS.
The Panel will identify the role of other service systems, including:
state housing
law enforcement
corrections agencies.
This will help ensure appropriate supports are in place to manage community safety concerns and the risks of re-offending.

about the justice panel
and its members.

Co-design
The Australian Government has outlined reforms to the NDIS that will ensure a better experience for participants and make sure the Scheme is there for the future.
We are committed to working with people with disability, their families, advocates, and the broader disability community to build a stronger NDIS informed by the voices of people with disability, their families and carers.
How we co-design
Our co-design approach makes sure the lived experience of people with disability and their families are at the centre of the way NDIS reforms are designed, implemented and monitored.
In 2024, we released a shared statement on co-design, in partnership with the Department of Social Services (DSS), NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission (Q&SC),
Independent Advisory Council (IAC)
and
Disability Representative and Carer Organisations (DRCOs)
. The shared statement commits us to working with the Australian disability community based on its agreed principles.
Co-design approach - shared statement (DOCX 352KB)

Co-design approach - shared statement Easy read (DOCX 50KB)
We use various co-design, consultation and engagement activities to reach participants, families, carers and supporters, as well as the public.
This ranges from engaging with peak bodies and sector representatives, having co-design workshops with participants, family members and carers, to surveys open to the public and people with disability.
We are currently focussed on the key aspects of Scheme reform and have established 4 co-design working groups:
Assessments and Budgeting
Navigator
Participant Pathway Experience
Participant Safeguarding
We are also co-designing the
Early Intervention Pathway for Children Younger Than 9
and
Legislation and other projects
.

Co-design Evaluation
In 2023, the NDIA commissioned an independent evaluation of the NDIA's co-design work. The review looked at what worked, what did not work, and any lessons for future processes. You can read the report and the Agency’s supporting statement on the
Co-design Evaluation webpage

Early Intervention Pathway for Children Younger Than 9
Listen
Print this page
Save page as PDF
Overview
The early intervention pathway for children younger than 9 initiative shows how in the future, a child younger than 9 will move through the steps of receiving support from the NDIS.​
The design of this new pathway was a recommendation from the independent NDIS Review.
The design of the new pathway is influenced by many different factors including legislation, rules, operational guidelines, people, processes and systems.​
While all children will move through some common steps in the new pathway, the exact steps they take and their experience of those steps is expected to be different.
It is important in designing the new pathway, the voices of parents and carers with a lived experience of having a child or children in the Scheme younger than 9 are heard. The NDIA has established several co-design mechanisms which will result in the voices of more than 100 parents and carers with a lived experience shaping the design of the new pathway across 2025. Co-design and consultation activities include workshops, surveys and interviews. Parents and carers are involved from an Expression of Interest process with Participant First members.
In the future the NDIA will also improve the pathway for children over 9, but the priority right now is children aged 9 and under.
Children’s Pathway Parent and Carer Engagement Group
This group is made up of parents and carers of children younger than 9 with a lived experience of disability. They meet to give the Agency advice on the design of the new pathway for children younger than 9.

Overview
The Navigator role comes from a report released by the NDIS Review in December 2023. This report recommended the creation of a local
navigation function
to support people with disability, participants and their families to find and use foundational, mainstream, community and NDIS services.
The Navigation Co-design Working Group (working group) provides advice on who the NDIA should engage with and what needs to be co-designed for the future Navigator service.
This includes how to best transition participants to the new model. These changes will take time and we want to make sure that they are done correctly.
The working group will also review and endorse the feedback and insights from our co-design and engagement activities.
Navigator Co-design Working Group
This Working Group is made up of participants,
Independent Advisory Council members
and
Disability Representative and Carer Organisation representatives
. They meet to provide advice and their lived experience perspective to inform the co-design of the new navigator role.
The Agency is committed to communicating about co-design, consultation and engagement activities and explaining what reforms will mean for participants.
To learn more about the work of the Navigator Co-design Working Group, please read the following meeting summaries:

Overview
The Assessment and Budgeting initiative is responsible for developing the new support needs assessment and budgeting approach needed for the new planning pathway.
The Assessment and Budgeting Co-design Working Group will focus on what needs to be co-designed together this year for new planning pathway reforms. This will include a new approach to assessing participant support needs and developing flexible budgets. The new planning pathway will start with a small group of participants to test and make sure we get these changes right.
The transition of participants to the new planning pathway will take place over time and will continue until mid-2031.
Assessment and Budgeting Co-design Working Group
This Working Group is made up of participants,
Independent Advisory Council
members and
Disability Representative and Carer Organisation representatives

Overview
The Participant Safeguarding initiative will develop an enhanced, proactive risk and safeguarding approach. The approach will improve the identification, assessment and response to risks of harm faced by NDIS participants such as violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation and financial misconduct. It aims to support people to build safeguards tailored to individual circumstances, proportionate to their level of risk and empower them to take part in their community.
The initiative will respond to the Disability Royal Commission and NDIS Review recommendations, as well as implement the
NDIA’s Participant Safeguarding Policy
.
In designing improvements to the approach to risk and safeguarding, it is important to listen to the voices of people with a disability who may be impacted, especially those with lived experience of the NDIS.  The new planning pathway will start with a small group of participants to test and make sure we get these changes right.
The transition of participants to the new planning pathway will take place over time and will continue until mid-2031.
Participant Safeguarding Co-design Working Group
This Working Group is made up of participants,
Independent Advisory Council members
and
Disability Representative and Carer Organisation representatives
. They meet to provide advice and their lived experience perspective on what needs to be co-designed to support enhancements to risk and safeguarding approaches including those linked to new planning pathway reforms.
To learn more about the work of the Participant Safeguarding Co-design Working Group, please read the following meeting summaries:
July 2025 – meeting summary coming soon
June 2025
May 2025
April 2025
Next Steps
Guided by the Working Group, the NDIA has started work to establish important mechanisms for co-design. This includes a series of workshops run by skilled and trusted organisations with broad networks across the sector. These workshops will bring together a diverse group of participants, families, carers and providers to shape how future safeguarding supports will work. Organisations have now delivered two workshops each, with the final two workshops expected to be delivered by August 2025.

Overview
The NDIS Review and previous research undertaken by the Agency has identified common challenges and barriers experienced by people with disability when accessing the NDIS and during the planning process.
The Access and Planning Pathways initiative is responsible for reforming the participant experience across the access and planning stages.
The new planning pathway will start with a small group of participants to test and make sure we get these changes right.
The transition of participants to the new planning pathway will take place over time and will continue until mid-2031.
Participant Pathway Experience Co-design Working Group
This Working Group is made up of participants,
Independent Advisory Council
members and
Disability Representative and Carer Organisation representatives
. They meet to provide advice co-design activities for new planning pathway reforms in 2025.
To learn more about the work of the Participant Pathway Experience Co-design Working Group, please read the following meeting summaries:

Independent Advisory Council End of Year Update 2015
Listen

Save page as PDF
This page contains the Independent Advisory Council End of Year Update 2015: Supporting an Ordinary Life for People with Disability.
The
NDIS Act 2013
establishes the Independent Advisory Council (IAC), its membership and independence. Its purpose is to provide independent advice to the NDIA Board on how the Agency performs its functions. The majority of IAC members must have a disability.
The IAC embodies the principle of co-design through its membership and strong connections with the community. The IAC strives to ensure the realisation of the vision and values of the NDIS Act – for the NDIS to contribute to people with disabilities becoming more independent, more included in mainstream social and economic participation and more self directing.
In its first two years, the IAC has focused on the fundamental design questions in the NDIS, such as what is an ordinary life and how can reasonable and necessary support assist people to move toward an ordinary life, which is a mainstream life in the Australian community.

Progress Report 2014

This Progress Report provided our first yearly update on building a world-leading National Disability Insurance Scheme.
The Progress Report benchmarks how we are tracking against the goals and outcomes identified in the National Disability Insurance Agency’s Strategic Plan 2013–2016. The Strategic Plan sets out the Agency’s values, goals and what we expect to achieve over the trial period of the Scheme – from 2013 to 2016.
There have been remarkable achievements in the last 12 months:
6434 participants have been found eligible for the Scheme, with 5414 having an approved plan by the end of March 2014.
The majority of participants are very satisfied, with a satisfaction rating of 1.66 on a scale of -2 (extremely unsatisfied) to +2 (extremely satisfied).
We have prepared to expand the NDIS trial sites across the whole of ACT, Barkly in the NT and Perth Hills, in WA. These sites join four existing one-year old sites in the Hunter (NSW), Barwon (VIC), South Australia (for children aged13 and under (on 1 July 2014)) and in Tasmania (for young people, aged 15 to 24 years). In addition, we are expanding our footprint by opening a new office in Colac in the Barwon region.
We have relocated our Head Office, with the Prime Minister, the Hon Tony Abbott, MP, opening the Head Office of the National Disability Insurance Agency in Geelong in April 2014.
We have recruited over 450 staff – of which almost 11 per cent identify as having a disability. Over 50 per cent of staff in the Agency have identified as having lived experience of disability – which refers to close or personal experience with disability.
We are continuing to implement major operational improvements to manage Scheme costs. At present costs remain comfortably within the allocated budget - around $107 million of support will flow to participants in 2013/14. This is well within the funding envelope of $152 million for 2013/14. Of course, we still have a significant amount of work to do. There are a number of areas where we need to improve and we are working hard to prioritise and implement these improvements as we go about pursuing our strategic goals, as set out in this Progress Report.

This Progress Report provides a year two update on progress towards building a world-leading National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).
The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) produced its
first Progress Report
in 2014 and committed to delivering yearly progress updates as the Agency move towards delivering the full scheme. The Progress Report is intended to complement the Agency’s Annual Report, which is tabled in Parliament in September of each year. The report demonstrates the Agency’s commitment to operating as a learning organisation, which means it listens and learns from the experiences of people with a disability and other key stakeholders.
This second Progress Report focuses on what the Agency has achieved in the last 12 months and benchmarks how it is tracking against the goals and outcomes identified in the Agency’s Strategic Plan 2013-2016.

KPMG Review of the optimal approach to transition to the full NDIS
Listen

Save page as PDF
The KPMG Paper explores some of the issues around the NDIS transition to full scheme.
NDIA chairman Bruce Bonyhady says the Agency is totally committed to delivering the full National Disability Insurance Scheme as quickly as possible and sustainably.
“What this KPMG paper does is identify some of the lessons from the trial sites to date together with some of the complexity surrounding rollout to full scheme. It is one of the many inputs, which will be considered as we start to talk to our stakeholders about the best way forward,” Mr Bonyhady says.
“We are committed to getting the NDIS right, both for those waiting on it now, and for future generations."

Review of the capabilities of the NDIA 2014
Listen
Print this page
Save page as PDF
In July last year, the staff of the National Disability Insurance Agency opened the doors in four sites across Australia to people with disability. Together, immediately, the Agency staff and the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) started to make real difference to people’s lives.
John from Tasmania has found a better and more secure future for his children.
“I feel reassured and more confident about my children’s future. I’m 59 years old, and I will love and support all of my children for as long I live. But I can’t do it at this level forever, and I don’t want to put that burden on my youngest daughter. Now I have more peace of mind that they will be looked after.”
Heather from Victoria has hopes that her boys are going to lead as normal lives as they possibly can.
“The NDIA is going to level the playing field for both Scott and Ben, give them access to programs that they've never been able to access before.”
More generally, satisfaction with the NDIS from participants is very high.
In the history of major social reform in Australia, there has never been a smoother start to a nation building program of the scope, necessity and ambition of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).
However, in late December, the Board decided that in the light of future demands on the Agency it was an appropriate time to commission an independent review of the capabilities of the Agency to ensure that it would be best positioned for the continuing rollout and development of the Scheme.
Mr Jeff Whalan AO, Dr Peter Acton and Dr Jeff Harmer AO conducted the review using the capability framework adopted by the Australian Public Service Commission. Similar frameworks are also used in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada. The fundamental purpose of such a review is to identify strengths and developmental areas in the context of the anticipated future operating environment.
As would be expected of a start-up organisation implementing such an ambitious national reform, areas were identified across the organisation that require priority action and development. This is not surprising particularly given the compressed timetable for establishing the Scheme.
The Board is pleased that the review provides clear guidance on where Management needs to direct its efforts to strengthen the Agency’s performance. As a result, the Board is in a much stronger position to ensure that the Agency is prioritising correctly, the Scheme is sustainable and that the expectations of all stakeholders are realistic.
Nation building reforms take time and must be managed carefully, based on a well-managed capacity to deliver the desired outcomes.
The review acknowledges the extraordinary achievement of the Agency in launching the Scheme so successfully and in retaining a high level of support from the Australian public.
However, it found that the focus on launch has been at the cost of building organisational capability for the future. A strong message of the review is that too much of the current effort of the Agency is on the short-term priorities and more attention needs to be given to planning, building and learning, including building the Agency itself, while relocating the head office to Geelong.
The Board welcomes the review and the positive response from the CEO, Mr David Bowen, and will monitor Management’s progress in implementing the necessary changes arising from the Review’s findings.
The Board is also intending to commission a follow up review in a year to ensure that the Agency’s capabilities continue to grow in line with the needs of the Scheme.
The Board and the staff of the Agency are fully committed to building an open, learning organisation that can deliver a long-term and sustainable Scheme for people with disability.
The Review is consistent with and supports these objectives.
The future success of the NDIS is dependent on the way the Agency learns from every experience and continually improves the operations of the Scheme and on behalf of the NDIA Board I wish to express our appreciation to all Agency staff for the huge effort and contribution you are making, particularly during these challenging first months establishing the Scheme.
Mr Bruce Bonyhady AM, Chair of the Board of the NDIA, 2014.

A key aim of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) is to assist people with disability to live “an ordinary life”. That is to fully realise their potential, to participate in and contribute to society, and to have a say in their own future – just as other members of Australian society do. The Scheme also involves families and carers, respecting their role whilst supporting them to achieve their goals by providing certainty of support for people with disability. These aims are embedded in the Scheme's legislation. The National Disability Insurance Agency is responsible for measuring and reporting on the Scheme's success against these aims.
What is the NDIS outcomes framework?
The Agency has developed an outcomes framework to measure the medium and long-term benefits of the NDIS for participants and their families.
The Agency will collect information from participants and families and carers on how they are progressing in different areas of their lives.
The Framework will allow tracking of participant and Scheme progress over time, and demonstrate how participants are faring relative to other Australians and other OECD countries.
It will also contribute to an understanding of what types of supports lead to good outcomes for people with disability, their families and carers.
Development of the outcomes framework
Development of the framework was guided by some basic principles, including that the indicators should be meaningful, informative, and feasible to collect and report.
A comprehensive review of other national and international frameworks was undertaken, together with an extensive consultation and co-design process that involved people with disability, members of the Independent Advisory Council (IAC) and CEO forum (CEOs of major providers, peak bodies and advocacy groups), disability researchers, experts working with specific cohorts (such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and Culturally and Linguistically Diverse communities), and intellectual disability experts.
Following this review and consultation, questionnaires were developed and piloted with a sample of NDIS participants, families and carers.
Almost 400 interviews were conducted during the pilot study, and the information collected was used to refine the questionnaires and inform implementation strategies.
Questionnaire domains
Building on research commissioned by the IAC, the outcomes framework adopts a lifespan approach to measuring outcomes, recognising that different outcomes will be important at different stages of life.
The questionnaires for adult participants collect information about eight domains or areas of life: choice and control, daily living activities, relationships, home, health and wellbeing, lifelong learning, work, and social, community and civic participation.

Some of the responsibilities of self-management include paying your providers and making claims.
Once you’ve arranged your NDIS supports and providers, you’ll need to pay for them using your NDIS funding.
As a self-manager, you’re responsible for paying your providers, contractors and staff. The NDIA can’t pay your providers for you.
If you don’t pay your providers, they may stop delivering services to you, pursue debt recovery or report your non-payment to the NDIA.
If you can’t keep on top of payments to providers, we may reconsider if self-management is right for you.
Payment options
As a self-manager there are 2 ways to pay for your NDIS supports with your NDIS funding.
1. Make a claim and then pay for your NDIS supports
After you receive an account, invoice or timesheet from your provider or staff, you can make a claim. The quickest and easiest way to do this is online using the portal or through the my NDIS app. Money from your NDIS plan budget will be paid into your nominated bank account. You can then pay your provider, contractor, or direct employment costs.
The instructions for the
my NDIS mobile app
will help you, your nominee or child representative to access and use the app.
2. Pay for your NDIS supports and then make a claim
After you receive your support, pay your provider or employee using your own money and get a receipt.
You’ll need to make a claim to have the money from your NDIS plan budget paid into your nominated bank account. You’ll be reimbursed, usually within 2 business days.
Make sure the amount of your claim matches the invoice or receipt from your provider, or if you’re directly engaging staff, your payroll records.
You may be required to upload evidence when you make your claim. Remember, you can’t make a claim before you receive your support.
New NDIS laws came into effect on 3 October 2024. All claims now need to be made within 2 years of providing the support.
For the first 12 months, we’ll honour all claims made for supports provided before the law came into effect.
Learn about how to claim from your plan in
Our Guideline – Your Plan
.
Setting up a bank account
When you self-manage, we can’t process your claims until you give us your bank account details.
Where possible, this should be a separate account just for NDIS funding that isn’t used for everyday living expenses.
Having a separate bank account for your NDIS funding makes it easier for you to see what money comes in and what payments go out.
NDIS funding will be paid into an account managed by the person responsible for self-managing the supports. This will be you as a participant, your plan nominee or a child representative for a participant under 18 years of age.
You can give us your bank account details at any time. You can talk to your my NDIS contact, call us, or record it in the portal.
Making a claim
Using the my NDIS portal or my NDIS app is the easiest and quickest way to make a claim. If you don’t have a plan in our new computer system, you’ll continue to use the myplace portal.
When you can’t use the portal or the app, you can use the
manual self-management claim form
on the NDIS website.
It’s important you claim after the support is provided. You’ll need evidence you received the support.
To learn more about making a claim, read:
How to use the myplace portal
my NDIS participant portal and app
.
Once you submit a claim, it will usually take 2 business days to be paid into your bank account.
Only you, a child representative, or your plan nominee can make claims in the portal or app.
Using the myplace portal
To make a claim:
Log in to the portal from the
NDIS website
or through
myGov
.
Select the My Payment Request option.
On the My Payment Requests screen, select Add My Payment Request.
Fill out the mandatory details of your request, including:
payee name
date of supports
support category
amount
description.
Enter the provider’s ABN or select the reason why you can’t from the drop-down:
The ABN was not provided in an accessible way.
I bought this item or NDIS support overseas.
I bought this item or NDIS support online.
I directly engage my own staff.
The business does not have an ABN.
We may ask you to upload evidence of the NDIS supports you purchased. For example, invoices and receipts from your provider. Even if we don’t ask you to upload evidence to submit your claim, we recommend that you do.
Preview, declare and submit your payment request.
The payment request needs to match the invoice or receipt from your provider, or if you’re directly engaging staff, your payroll records. It should be made against the support category that matches your support purchase.
Learn more about using the
myplace portal
.
Using the my NDIS portal or app
To make a claim from your self-managed budget in the my NDIS portal or app:
Log into the my NDIS portal through myGov, or open the my NDIS app on your device.
Select the Claim tab.
On the Claim screen, select Make a claim.
Select Claim with a new payee, a provider from your Payee list, or a regular claim from Favourites.
Enter the payee’s details and ABN, or select a reason why you can’t from the drop down:
The ABN was not provided in an accessible way.
I bought this item or NDIS support overseas.
I bought this item or NDIS support online.
I directly engage my own staff.
The business does not have an ABN.
Fill out the mandatory details of your claim, including:
date of supports
support category
description
amount.
We may ask you to upload evidence of the NDIS supports you purchased. For example, invoices and receipts from your provider. Even if we don’t ask you to upload evidence to submit your claim, we recommend that you do.
You can save favourite claims to make claiming for regular supports even faster. Declare and submit your claim.
Visit our
Paying for your supports
page to learn more about using the portal. You can also visit our
Making claims
page to learn more about using the app.
These instructions are only for digital claims using the myplace portal or app.
Using the payment request form
When you can’t use the portal or the app, you can use the
manual self-management claim form
. You can return your form in person, by post or email.
When you return your form, you need to provide evidence of the supports you purchased.
What happens if you make a mistake?
We know self-managers try to do the right thing but sometimes make mistakes. We want to help participants, nominees and child representatives learn how to do the right thing before it becomes an issue.
If you make a mistake, we’ll work with you to fix it.
To fix a mistake in your claim, you can cancel a paid claim in the portal or app, call us, or submit a payment enquiry in the portal. Our payment team will work with you to resolve the issue.
How to avoid common claiming mistakes
It’s important to make sure your claims are complete and accurate, and you have the right invoices and records to match your requests.
To make sure your claims are right, you should check:
you enter the correct start and end date for the support you’re claiming
the payment amount you enter in the portal or app matches the amount on the invoice or receipt. Sometimes there might be an extra digit added by mistake or a decimal point in the wrong spot
you’re making the claim against the right support category and that this category is self-managed
you have enough funds in the relevant funding component amount for the current funding period to purchase the support
you have enough funds in your plan for the claim.

International Day of People with Disability
Transcript for '
NDIS celebrates diversity for IDPWD 2018
'
Today is International Day of People with Disability (IDPwD), a United Nations sanctioned day aimed at increasing awareness, understanding and acceptance of people with disability, while also celebrating their achievements and contributions.
IDPwD is a significant day for the NDIA as we continue to deliver the world-leading NDIS - a Scheme providing Australians with a significant and permanent disability and their families the supports they need to participate fully in their communities.
This year’s IDPWD focus is on how we can celebrate diversity and strive for inclusion through the removal of barriers for people with disability within the community.
Watch and share this video featuring NDIS participants telling us about how we can change attitudes, celebrate diversity and embrace equality.
We are proud of our dedication and commitment as the Agency delivering the NDIS, which is now supporting more than 200,000 Australians with a disability in providing them with supports and services they need to achieve their goals.
I encourage everyone to reflect on the positive impact the Scheme is having on the lives of Australians with disability, including 1 in 3 people who are receiving supports for the first time.
